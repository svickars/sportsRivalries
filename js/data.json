It is regarded as one of the most competitive and longest-standing rivalries in American baseball, with some observers considering it the greatest baseball rivalry of all time.<BR><BR>The rivalry between the Dodgers and Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in the New York City area. The Dodgers played in Brooklyn (then a separate city, before being incorporated as a borough of Greater New York in 1898) and the Giants played at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan.<BR><BR>After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in the economic, cultural, and political arenas, the teams' new homes in California were fertile ground for the rivalry's transplantation.<BR><BR>Each team's ability to endure for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history.<BR><BR>While the Dodgers have won the National League West fourteen times compared to the Giants' eight since the beginning of the Divisional Era in 1969, the Giants have more total wins, head-to-head wins, National League pennants, and World Series titles in franchise history. Since moving to California, Los Angeles holds the edge in pennants (9–6) and World Series titles (5–3). Each team has advanced to the postseason as the wild card twice, the Giants most recently in 2016. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers' last title came in the 1988 World Series.","number":"15"},{"team":"Chicago Cubs","teamLocation":"Chicago","teamName":"Cubs","teamAbb":"CHC","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"1.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of Route 66","opponentTeam":"St. Louis Cardinals","opponent":"cardinals","opponentWins":"cardinals1163","league":"MLB","wins":"1137","oWins":"1106","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"1106","oLosses":"1137","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"9731","oFor":"9847","against":"9847","oAgainst":"9731","gamesPlayed":"2260","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Chicago, IL","stateAbb":"IL","state":"Illinois","country":"United States","lat":"41.95","lng":"-87.66","illX":"534.38","illY":"551.18","cBack":"#002F6C","cOutline":"#C8102E","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#0A2252","ocOutline":"#C41E3A","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"cubs","bothTeamsBackwards":"cardinals-cubs","bothTeams":"cubs-cardinals","oldID":"cubs1137","extraClass":"cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi","oldClass":"mlb baseball  chicago-cubs chc chicago cubs il illinois united-states cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi","class":"mlb baseball  chicago-cubs chc chicago cubs il illinois united-states cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi cubs-cardinals cardinals cubbies chicago-cubbies chi-town chi mlb baseball  st-louis-cardinals stl stlc st louis cardinals mo missouri united-states cards st-louis-cards cards st-louis-cards geographic battle of route 66 battle-of-route-66","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 64, "losses": 74, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks64" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 1043, "losses": 872, "opponentWins": "braves1043" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "orioles6" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "redSox7" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 51, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "whiteSox51" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 1061, "losses": 1043, "opponentWins": "reds1061" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 9, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "indians9" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 95, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "rockies95" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 5, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "tigers5" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 333, "losses": 378, "opponentWins": "astros333" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 12, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "royals12" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 9, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "angels9" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 956, "losses": 964, "opponentWins": "dodgers956" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 93, "losses": 92, "opponentWins": "marlins93" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 159, "losses": 152, "opponentWins": "brewers159" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 14, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "twins14" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 368, "losses": 357, "opponentWins": "mets368" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 4, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "yankees4" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 8, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "athletics8" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 1078, "losses": 975, "opponentWins": "phillies1078" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 1083, "losses": 1164, "opponentWins": "pirates1083" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 258, "losses": 214, "opponentWins": "padres258" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 926, "losses": 1005, "opponentWins": "sfGiants926" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 9, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "mariners9" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 1137, "losses": 1106, "opponentWins": "cardinals1137" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 3, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "rays3" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 8, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "tRangers8" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "blueJays4" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 288, "losses": 311, "opponentWins": "nationals288" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Cardinals–Cubs rivalry, also called the Route 66 rivalry and The Downstate Illinois rivalry, refers to the rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs both of the National League (NL), one of the most bitter rivalries in Major League Baseball and in all of North American professional sports. The Cubs lead the regular season series 1,197–1,147, with 19 ties, through 2015, while the Cardinals are third in NL pennants with 19, to the Cubs' 16. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to World Series success, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3.

It is regarded as one of the most competitive and longest-standing rivalries in American baseball, with some observers considering it the greatest baseball rivalry of all time.<BR><BR>The rivalry between the Dodgers and Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in the New York City area. The Dodgers played in Brooklyn (then a separate city, before being incorporated as a borough of Greater New York in 1898) and the Giants played at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan.<BR><BR>After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in the economic, cultural, and political arenas, the teams' new homes in California were fertile ground for the rivalry's transplantation.<BR><BR>Each team's ability to endure for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history.<BR><BR>While the Dodgers have won the National League West fourteen times compared to the Giants' eight since the beginning of the Divisional Era in 1969, the Giants have more total wins, head-to-head wins, National League pennants, and World Series titles in franchise history. Since moving to California, Los Angeles holds the edge in pennants (9–6) and World Series titles (5–3). Each team has advanced to the postseason as the wild card twice, the Giants most recently in 2016. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers' last title came in the 1988 World Series.","number":"15"},{"team":"New York Yankees","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Yankees","teamAbb":"NYY","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"4.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Boston Red Sox","opponent":"redSox","opponentWins":"redSox981","league":"MLB","wins":"1169","oWins":"973","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"973","oLosses":"1169","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"10341","oFor":"9416","against":"9416","oAgainst":"10341","gamesPlayed":"2156","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.83","lng":"-73.93","illX":"1139.50","illY":"1065.10","cBack":"#1C2841","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#808080","ocBack":"#002244","ocOutline":"#C60C30","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"yankees","bothTeamsBackwards":"redSox-yankees","bothTeams":"yankees-redSox","oldID":"yankees1169","extraClass":"nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks","oldClass":"mlb baseball  new-york-yankees nyy new york yankees ny new york united-states nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks","class":"mlb baseball  new-york-yankees nyy new york yankees ny new york united-states nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks yankees-redSox redSox nyc ny-yankees yanks ny-yanks new-york-yanks mlb baseball  boston-red-sox bos boston red sox ma massachusetts united-states sox boston-sox sox boston-sox redsox red-sox divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks12" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 19, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "braves19" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 1277, "losses": 874, "opponentWins": "orioles1277" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 1169, "losses": 973, "opponentWins": "redSox1169" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 9, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "cubs9" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 1059, "losses": 817, "opponentWins": "whiteSox1059" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 8, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "reds8" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 1096, "losses": 862, "opponentWins": "indians1096" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 10, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "rockies10" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 1044, "losses": 922, "opponentWins": "tigers1044" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 22, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "astros22" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 285, "losses": 193, "opponentWins": "royals285" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 354, "losses": 291, "opponentWins": "angels354" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "dodgers6" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "marlins13" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 212, "losses": 184, "opponentWins": "brewers212" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 1112, "losses": 762, "opponentWins": "twins1112" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 62, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "mets62" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 1124, "losses": 762, "opponentWins": "athletics1124" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 13, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "phillies13" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 9, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "pirates9" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 9, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "padres9" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "sfGiants7" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 229, "losses": 178, "opponentWins": "mariners229" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cardinals6" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 196, "losses": 136, "opponentWins": "rays196" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 380, "losses": 269, "opponentWins": "tRangers380" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 327, "losses": 267, "opponentWins": "blueJays327" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 15, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "nationals15" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is a rivalry between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox baseball teams of Major League Baseball (MLB). The two teams have competed in MLB's American League (AL) for over 100 seasons and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports. In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the &apos;Curse of the Bambino&apos;, which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States. Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had featured one or both of the AL East rivals since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).<BR><BR>The Yankees and the Red Sox finished tied for first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker game for the division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.<BR><BR>The Yankees–Red Sox match-up is regarded by some sports journalists as the greatest rivalry in sports. Games between the two teams often generate considerable interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. Many national networks, including ESPN and Fox Sports, broadcast the games on the weekend. Yankees–Red Sox games are some of the most-watched MLB games each season. Outside of baseball, the rivalry between the two teams has led to violence between fans, along with attention from politicians and other athletes.","number":"21"},{"team":"Los Angeles Dodgers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Dodgers","teamAbb":"LAD","teamNotes":"f.

Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span, combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from 1970–1990.

Both clubs are members of MLB's National League (NL); the Phillies are members of the NL East division, while the Pirates are members of the NL Central division. The rivalry was considered by some to be one of the best in the NL. The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered NL play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.<BR><BR>The Phillies and Pirates had remained together after the NL split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two NL East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s, the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.<BR><BR>After the Pirates moved to the NL Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.

The two teams have competed in MLB's American League (AL) for over 100 seasons and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports. In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the &apos;Curse of the Bambino&apos;, which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States. Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had featured one or both of the AL East rivals since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).<BR><BR>The Yankees and the Red Sox finished tied for first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker game for the division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.<BR><BR>The Yankees–Red Sox match-up is regarded by some sports journalists as the greatest rivalry in sports. Games between the two teams often generate considerable interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. Many national networks, including ESPN and Fox Sports, broadcast the games on the weekend. Yankees–Red Sox games are some of the most-watched MLB games each season. Outside of baseball, the rivalry between the two teams has led to violence between fans, along with attention from politicians and other athletes.","number":"21"},{"team":"Philadelphia Phillies","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Phillies","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"12.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"Battle of the Broads","opponentTeam":"New York Mets","opponent":"mets","opponentWins":"mets456","league":"MLB","wins":"493","oWins":"456","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"456","oLosses":"493","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"4022","oFor":"3979","against":"3979","oAgainst":"4022","gamesPlayed":"950","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.91","lng":"-75.17","illX":"819.31","illY":"1078.14","cBack":"#BA0C2E","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#003086","ocBack":"#002D70","ocOutline":"#FC4C00","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"phillies","bothTeamsBackwards":"mets-phillies","bothTeams":"phillies-mets","oldID":"phillies493","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"mlb baseball  philadelphia-phillies phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly","class":"mlb baseball  philadelphia-phillies phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly phillies-mets mets philly mlb baseball  new-york-mets nym new york mets ny new york united-states metropolitans new-york-metropolitans ny-mets ny metropolitans new-york-metropolitans ny-mets ny divisional battle of the broads battle-of-the-broads","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 68, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks68" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 1023, "losses": 1100, "opponentWins": "braves1023" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 23, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "orioles23" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 23, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "redSox23" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 975, "losses": 1078, "opponentWins": "cubs975" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "whiteSox10" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 858, "losses": 1057, "opponentWins": "reds858" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "indians10" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 104, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "rockies104" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 7, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "tigers7" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 292, "losses": 277, "opponentWins": "astros292" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 6, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "royals6" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 1, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "angels1" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 841, "losses": 1077, "opponentWins": "dodgers841" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 218, "losses": 179, "opponentWins": "marlins218" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 72, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "brewers72" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "twins8" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 493, "losses": 456, "opponentWins": "mets493" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 14, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "yankees14" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "athletics7" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 930, "losses": 1121, "opponentWins": "pirates930" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 264, "losses": 207, "opponentWins": "padres264" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 786, "losses": 1120, "opponentWins": "sfGiants786" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "mariners4" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 894, "losses": 1170, "opponentWins": "cardinals894" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 9, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "rays9" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "tRangers7" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 21, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "blueJays21" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 422, "losses": 395, "opponentWins": "nationals422" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Mets–Phillies rivalry or Battle of the Broads is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.

upstart Kings would develop a hated, & competitive rivalry with the Lakers in the 2000s. In 2000, the Lakers were the best team in the league. However, the 8th-seeded Kings surprised everyone and pushed them in the first round, but lost the series 3–2. After the Kings traded for Doug Christie the Kings looked poise to challenge the reigning, defending champion Lakers, but In 2001, the Lakers swept the Kings in the Western Conference semifinals. However the Kings traded for Mike Bibby & earned the top playoff seed in the 2002 NBA Playoffs. In the 2002 Western Conference Finals, the Kings went toe-to-toe with the back-to-back NBA Champion Lakers. In one of the most memorable playoff series of all time, & numerous buzzer beaters Sacramento was favored and went up 3–2 in the series. The Kings lost Game 6 at Staples Center in Los Angeles on what many call the most controversial Playoff game of all time. As Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the face,Sacramento lost Game 7 in Sacramento in OT, & the Lakers would end up three-peating. NBA expert Roland Beech analyzed the calls and stated that he found that the controversial calls favored the Lakers not in huge numbers (9 total calls), but a lopsided (7–2) rate, however many believe the NBA pushed for a Game 7 seeing as how the Finals looked to be a lopsided series whether it was the Kings or the Lakers playing the Nets. Fights would occur in the ongoing years including the Rick Fox & Doug Christie famous brawl. As well & Shaq dissing Sacramento. Fans hated each other as well. However, as the Kings have fell from atop the Western Conference powerhouses as has the rivalry in recent years. Both the Lakers and Kings have made serious declines, but it has been stated that DeMarcus Cousins wants to be traded to the Lakers in the coming future.","number":"52"},{"team":"Les Canadiens de

The 2 teams were considered the best in the entire American League, and met 4 times in the ALCS, from 1976 to 1980. The first 2 championships between the 2 teams ended in 5 games, with the 1976 edition ending on a memorable Chris Chambliss walk-off homerun in the 9th inning. The 1977 edition would end on yet another Yankees comeback, battling down 2 games to 1 and rallying in the final 2 innings in Kansas City, down 1–3, and winning 5–3, and going on to win the 1977 World Series. However, in 1980, the roles would be reversed, with Kansas City sweeping New York, though would fall to the Philadelphia in the World Series.<BR><BR>Perhaps the most infamous moment between the 2 teams though, was the Pine Tar Incident, in which George Brett blasted a 2 run home run in a game between the 2 teams on July 24, 1983 in Yankee Stadium. Yankees skipper Billy Martin protested the home run, noticing a large amount of pine tar on Brett's bat. The umpires agreed with Martin, ruling the amount of pine tar exceeded what was allowed, and therefore Brett was called out. The Royals protested this decision, and AL president at the time Lee MacPhail agreed, and restarted the game after Brett's home run on August 18, with the Royals holding on to a 5-4 lead. The rivalry would have been renewed had the Yankees defeated the Astros in the 2015 wild card match.","number":"11"},{"team":"Detroit Red Wings","teamLocation":"Detroit","teamName":"Red

is a National Hockey League (NHL) rivalry between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings.

The teams both compete in the Atlantic Division and with current NHL scheduling, they meet four to five times per season.<BR><BR>Both teams are Original Six teams, with their first game played in Detroit&apos;s inaugural season in 1927. From 1929-1993, the two teams met each other in the 16 playoff series, and faced each other in seven Stanley Cup Finals.

With the score tied 2-2, two outs, and Rougned Odor on third base, Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin accidentally hit the bat of Rangers outfielder Shin Soo Choo on his throw back to the mound, and Odor came around to score on the error. After a lengthy review process, the umpires determined that Odor should be allowed to score, infuriating the Toronto crowd; Choo would strike out on the next pitch to end the inning. In the bottom half, with Martin leading off, he hit a ground ball that was bobbled by Elvis Andrus and reached base. The next batter, Kevin Pillar, hit a grounder to Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland who's low throw could not be handled by Andrus, leading to another error and two men on, nobody out, with Ryan Goins coming to the plate. Goins bunted the ball to the third base side, where it was fielded by Adrian Beltre, who threw to Andrus covering third base. Andrus again kicked the ball, his second error of the inning, to load the bases, with still nobody out. After Ben Revere hit a weak grounder which Texas cut down the run at the plate to get the first out, Sam Dyson came on to pitch with the bases still loaded, but one out. Jays third baseman and 2015 AL MVP Josh Donaldson hit a flare to the right side, and Odor misplayed the ball, leading to the tying run crossing the plate. However, on the same play, he was able to recover in time to throw to second base for the second out, bringing up slugging Jays outfielder Jose Bautista with runners on the corners and two outs. On a 1-1 count, Bautista smoked a line drive home run to left field to put Toronto ahead 6-3, and did a dramatic bat flip to celebrate. The Rangers took offense to Bautista's actions, and the benches cleared. The same score would hold the rest of the game, sending the Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series, and the Rangers back home.<BR><BR>The following season, on May 15, 2016, the two teams met again for the final time of the regular season, at Globe Life Park in Arlington, home of the Rangers. In the top of the eighth inning, with the Blue Jays batting but the Rangers leading 7-6, pitcher Matt Bush hit Jose Bautista with a pitch. Two batters later, Justin Smoak was at bat for Toronto. With one out, and Bautista on first, Smoak hit a ground ball to Beltre at third base, who relayed to Odor at second, and then to Moreland at first to complete the inning ending double play. However, on that play, Bautista took a hard slide into Odor at second, which Odor took exception to. After some pushing and shoving, Odor punched Bautista in the face with a right hook, and the benches cleared. For their roles in the altercation, Odor was suspended eight games; Bautista one. Following the Blue Jays defeat of the Baltimore Orioles in the 2016 American League Wild Card Game, the Rangers and Blue Jays met once again in the 2016 American League Division Series where once again, the Blue Jays defeated the Rangers in a sweep 3 games to 0.","number":"27"},{"team":"Chicago White Sox","teamLocation":"Chicago","teamName":"White

started in the seventh inning of Game 5 in the 2015 ALDS. With the score tied 2-2, two outs, and Rougned Odor on third base, Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin accidentally hit the bat of Rangers outfielder Shin Soo Choo on his throw back to the mound, and Odor came around to score on the error. After a lengthy review process, the umpires determined that Odor should be allowed to score, infuriating the Toronto crowd; Choo would strike out on the next pitch to end the inning. In the bottom half, with Martin leading off, he hit a ground ball that was bobbled by Elvis Andrus and reached base. The next batter, Kevin Pillar, hit a grounder to Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland who's low throw could not be handled by Andrus, leading to another error and two men on, nobody out, with Ryan Goins coming to the plate. Goins bunted the ball to the third base side, where it was fielded by Adrian Beltre, who threw to Andrus covering third base. Andrus again kicked the ball, his second error of the inning, to load the bases, with still nobody out. After Ben Revere hit a weak grounder which Texas cut down the run at the plate to get the first out, Sam Dyson came on to pitch with the bases still loaded, but one out. Jays third baseman and 2015 AL MVP Josh Donaldson hit a flare to the right side, and Odor misplayed the ball, leading to the tying run crossing the plate. However, on the same play, he was able to recover in time to throw to second base for the second out, bringing up slugging Jays outfielder Jose Bautista with runners on the corners and two outs. On a 1-1 count, Bautista smoked a line drive home run to left field to put Toronto ahead 6-3, and did a dramatic bat flip to celebrate. The Rangers took offense to Bautista's actions, and the benches cleared. The same score would hold the rest of the game, sending the Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series, and the Rangers back home.<BR><BR>The following season, on May 15, 2016, the two teams met again for the final time of the regular season, at Globe Life Park in Arlington, home of the Rangers. In the top of the eighth inning, with the Blue Jays batting but the Rangers leading 7-6, pitcher Matt Bush hit Jose Bautista with a pitch. Two batters later, Justin Smoak was at bat for Toronto. With one out, and Bautista on first, Smoak hit a ground ball to Beltre at third base, who relayed to Odor at second, and then to Moreland at first to complete the inning ending double play. However, on that play, Bautista took a hard slide into Odor at second, which Odor took exception to. After some pushing and shoving, Odor punched Bautista in the face with a right hook, and the benches cleared. For their roles in the altercation, Odor was suspended eight games; Bautista one. Following the Blue Jays defeat of the Baltimore Orioles in the 2016 American League Wild Card Game, the Rangers and Blue Jays met once again in the 2016 American League Division Series where once again, the Blue Jays defeated the Rangers in a sweep 3 games to 0.","number":"27"},{"team":"Boston

The 2 teams were considered the best in the entire American League, and met 4 times in the ALCS, from 1976 to 1980. The first 2 championships between the 2 teams ended in 5 games, with the 1976 edition ending on a memorable Chris Chambliss walk-off homerun in the 9th inning. The 1977 edition would end on yet another Yankees comeback, battling down 2 games to 1 and rallying in the final 2 innings in Kansas City, down 1–3, and winning 5–3, and going on to win the 1977 World Series. However, in 1980, the roles would be reversed, with Kansas City sweeping New York, though would fall to the Philadelphia in the World Series.<BR><BR>Perhaps the most infamous moment between the 2 teams though, was the Pine Tar Incident, in which George Brett blasted a 2 run home run in a game between the 2 teams on July 24, 1983 in Yankee Stadium. Yankees skipper Billy Martin protested the home run, noticing a large amount of pine tar on Brett's bat. The umpires agreed with Martin, ruling the amount of pine tar exceeded what was allowed, and therefore Brett was called out. The Royals protested this decision, and AL president at the time Lee MacPhail agreed, and restarted the game after Brett's home run on August 18, with the Royals holding on to a 5-4 lead. The rivalry would have been renewed had the Yankees defeated the Astros in the 2015 wild card match.","number":"11"},{"team":"Boston Red Sox","teamLocation":"Boston","teamName":"Red Sox","teamAbb":"BOS","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"38.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Tampa Bay Rays","opponent":"rays","opponentWins":"rays143","league":"MLB","wins":"192","oWins":"143","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"143","oLosses":"192","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1688","oFor":"1388","against":"1388","oAgainst":"1688","gamesPlayed":"335","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Boston, MA","stateAbb":"MA","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","lat":"42.35","lng":"-71.10","illX":"1278.68","illY":"623.09","cBack":"#002244","cOutline":"#C60C30","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#00285D","ocOutline":"#79BDEE","ocText":"#FFD700","teamSmall":"redSox","bothTeamsBackwards":"rays-redSox","bothTeams":"redSox-rays","oldID":"redSox192","extraClass":"sox boston-sox red-sox redsox","oldClass":"mlb baseball  boston-red-sox bos   ma massachusetts united-states sox boston-sox sox boston-sox red-sox redsox","class":"mlb baseball  boston-red-sox bos   ma massachusetts united-states sox boston-sox sox boston-sox red-sox redsox redSox-rays rays sox boston-sox red-sox redsox mlb baseball  tampa-bay-rays tb tampa bay rays fl florida united-states tampa tampa-rays devil-rays tampa-devil-rays tampa-bay-devil-rays tampa tampa-rays devil-rays tampa-devil-rays tampa-bay-devil-rays devilrays divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks12" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 35, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "braves35" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 25, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "orioles25" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 1191, "losses": 990, "opponentWins": "orioles1191" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "cubs5" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 976, "losses": 938, "opponentWins": "whiteSox976" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 9, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "reds9" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 977, "losses": 1036, "opponentWins": "indians977" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 10, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "rockies10" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 1033, "losses": 969, "opponentWins": "tigers1033" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 24, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "astros24" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 233, "losses": 231, "opponentWins": "royals233" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 338, "losses": 302, "opponentWins": "angels338" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 8, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "dodgers8" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 22, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "marlins22" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 218, "losses": 188, "opponentWins": "brewers218" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 968, "losses": 935, "opponentWins": "twins968" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "mets13" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 973, "losses": 1169, "opponentWins": "yankees973" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 1072, "losses": 878, "opponentWins": "athletics1072" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 36, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "phillies36" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "pirates5" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "padres12" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 11, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "sfGiants11" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 235, "losses": 174, "opponentWins": "mariners235" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "cardinals4" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 192, "losses": 143, "opponentWins": "rays192" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 340, "losses": 312, "opponentWins": "tRangers340" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 325, "losses": 272, "opponentWins": "blueJays325" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 15, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "nationals15" } ],"rivalryNotes":"While not as nationally famous as some matchups, the Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays also have a rivalry that has been the focus of some memorable incidents plus, the two teams met in the 2008 ALCS with the Rays winning the series en route to their first World Series appearance:","number":"26"},{"team":"Los Angeles Dodgers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Dodgers","teamAbb":"LAD","teamNotes":"f.

This can be traced to a fall game where Dodgers reliever Hong-Chih Kuo threw at the Diamondbacks' Gerardo Parra, who took exception to it – and later hit a home run off Kuo, sparking harsh words from the Dodgers (particularly Clayton Kershaw, who screamed at Parra all the way to home plate). Kershaw, in turn, hit Parra with a pitch the following night; in their next game together in May 2012, the D-Backs' Ian Kennedy retaliated. However the rivalry hit a fever pitch in June 2013, when Kennedy hit the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, prompting Zack Greinke to retaliate by hitting Miguel Montero. However, Kennedy then proceeded to hit Greinke himself, and a furious bench-clearing brawl began. Later that fall, the Dodgers clinched the NL West title – at Chase Field, the home of the Diamondbacks. After the game, Dodger players jumped into the pool at the Diamondbacks' home ballpark; no brawls occurred (the opposing players and fans had all left), but many Arizona players and supporters, even Senator John McCain, (to which Dodgers reliever Brian Wilson shot back that the one-time presidential candidate &apos;knows a thing or two about coming in second&apos;) expressed extreme displeasure at this &apos;arrogant, immature&apos; display. Fuel was added to the fire when in 2016, Dodgers ace, Zack Greinke left town for Arizona after the Dodgers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs earlier that year.","number":"14"},{"team":"Milwaukee

rivalry with the Lakers in the 2000s. In 2000, the Lakers were the best team in the league. However, the 8th-seeded Kings surprised everyone and pushed them in the first round, but lost the series 3–2. After the Kings traded for Doug Christie the Kings looked poise to challenge the reigning, defending champion Lakers, but In 2001, the Lakers swept the Kings in the Western Conference semifinals. However the Kings traded for Mike Bibby & earned the top playoff seed in the 2002 NBA Playoffs. In the 2002 Western Conference Finals, the Kings went toe-to-toe with the back-to-back NBA Champion Lakers. In one of the most memorable playoff series of all time, & numerous buzzer beaters Sacramento was favored and went up 3–2 in the series. The Kings lost Game 6 at Staples Center in Los Angeles on what many call the most controversial Playoff game of all time. As Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the face,Sacramento lost Game 7 in Sacramento in OT, & the Lakers would end up three-peating. NBA expert Roland Beech analyzed the calls and stated that he found that the controversial calls favored the Lakers not in huge numbers (9 total calls), but a lopsided (7–2) rate, however many believe the NBA pushed for a Game 7 seeing as how the Finals looked to be a lopsided series whether it was the Kings or the Lakers playing the Nets. Fights would occur in the ongoing years including the Rick Fox & Doug Christie famous brawl. As well & Shaq dissing Sacramento. Fans hated each other as well. However, as the Kings have fell from atop the Western Conference powerhouses as has the rivalry in recent years. Both the Lakers and Kings have made serious declines, but it has been stated that DeMarcus Cousins wants to be traded to the Lakers in the coming future.","number":"52"},{"team":"Los Angeles

Despite playing the role of underdog in all 3 of their final round meetings with Los Angeles, Detroit enjoyed significant success against the Lakers, claiming the NBA title against them twice.","number":"51"},{"team":"Arizona Diamondbacks","teamLocation":"Arizona","teamName":"Diamondbacks","teamAbb":"ARI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"46.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Dodgers","opponent":"dodgers","opponentWins":"dodgers186","league":"MLB","wins":"148","oWins":"186","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"186","oLosses":"148","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1320","oFor":"1498","against":"1498","oAgainst":"1320","gamesPlayed":"334","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Phoenix, AZ","stateAbb":"AZ","state":"Arizona","country":"United States","lat":"33.45","lng":"-112.07","illX":"447.87","illY":"1384.77","cBack":"#A71930","cOutline":"#D9C89EC","cText":"#09ADAD","ocBack":"#002F6C","ocOutline":"#FFFFFF","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"diamondbacks","bothTeamsBackwards":"dodgers-diamondbacks","bothTeams":"diamondbacks-dodgers","oldID":"diamondbacks148","extraClass":"phoenix diamond backs diamond-bakcs","oldClass":"mlb baseball  arizona-diamondbacks ari arizona diamondbacks az arizona united-states phoenix phoenix diamond backs diamond-bakcs","class":"mlb baseball  arizona-diamondbacks ari arizona diamondbacks az arizona united-states phoenix phoenix diamond backs diamond-bakcs diamondbacks-dodgers dodgers phoenix diamond backs diamond-bakcs mlb baseball  los-angeles-dodgers lad los angeles dodgers ca california united-states la la-dodgers la la-dodgers divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 59, "losses": 72, "opponentWins": "braves59" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "orioles12" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 6, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "redSox6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 74, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "cubs74" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "whiteSox7" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 62, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "reds62" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 7, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "indians7" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 191, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "rockies191" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 16, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "tigers16" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 68, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "astros68" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "royals13" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 11, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "angels11" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 148, "losses": 186, "opponentWins": "dodgers148" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 76, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "marlins76" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 66, "losses": 66, "opponentWins": "brewers66" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "twins8" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 64, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "mets64" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 6, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "yankees6" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 15, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "athletics15" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 61, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "phillies61" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 70, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "pirates70" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 177, "losses": 159, "opponentWins": "padres177" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 142, "losses": 192, "opponentWins": "sfGiants142" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 10, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "mariners10" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 51, "losses": 82, "opponentWins": "cardinals51" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "rays8" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 13, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "tRangers13" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 7, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJays7" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 55, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "nationals55" } ],"rivalryNotes":"While the nascent Diamondbacks had, since the team's inception in 1998, not found themselves with any serious rivalries for most of their existence, 2011 saw the birth of a fast brewing rivalry with the Dodgers. This can be traced to a fall game where Dodgers reliever Hong-Chih Kuo threw at the Diamondbacks' Gerardo Parra, who took exception to it – and later hit a home run off Kuo, sparking harsh words from the Dodgers (particularly Clayton Kershaw, who screamed at Parra all the way to home plate). Kershaw, in turn, hit Parra with a pitch the following night; in their next game together in May 2012, the D-Backs' Ian Kennedy retaliated. However the rivalry hit a fever pitch in June 2013, when Kennedy hit the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, prompting Zack Greinke to retaliate by hitting Miguel Montero. However, Kennedy then proceeded to hit Greinke himself, and a furious bench-clearing brawl began. Later that fall, the Dodgers clinched the NL West title – at Chase Field, the home of the Diamondbacks. After the game, Dodger players jumped into the pool at the Diamondbacks' home ballpark; no brawls occurred (the opposing players and fans had all left), but many Arizona players and supporters, even Senator John McCain, (to which Dodgers reliever Brian Wilson shot back that the one-time presidential candidate &apos;knows a thing or two about coming in second&apos;) expressed extreme displeasure at this &apos;arrogant, immature&apos; display. Fuel was added to the fire when in 2016, Dodgers ace, Zack Greinke left town for Arizona after the Dodgers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs earlier that year.","number":"14"},{"team":"Los

are rival teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The two Pacific Division teams both play their home games at Staples Center in Los Angeles, inspiring their matchups to sometimes be called the &apos;Hallway Series&apos;. The Lakers relocated from Minneapolis in 1960, while the Clippers moved from San Diego in 1984. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. The Lakers have won 11 of their 16 NBA championships since moving to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Clippers have made the playoffs only eight times since 1984 and were long considered the laughingstock of the NBA; in the history of the franchise, they have never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Some contended that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful. For the first time in 20 years, the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers in 2012–13. This was the first of four straight season series victories for the Clippers, which included season sweeps in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Lakers hold a 98–44 advantage in the all-time series against the Clippers.[a] The two teams have never met in the playoffs.","number":"50"},{"team":"Philadelphia Flyers","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Flyers","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"48.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of the Keystone State","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Penguins","opponent":"penguins","opponentWins":"penguins96","league":"NHL","wins":"151","oWins":"97","ties":"30","oTies":"30","losses":"89","oLosses":"144","otLosses":"8","oOtLosses":"7","for":"1001","oFor":"851","against":"851","oAgainst":"1001","gamesPlayed":"278","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"984.40","illY":"1125.50","cBack":"#F4793E","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#C5B358","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"flyers","bothTeamsBackwards":"penguins-flyers","bothTeams":"flyers-penguins","oldID":"flyers151","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi philadelphia flyers pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly","class":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi philadelphia flyers pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly flyers-penguins penguins philly nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit pittsburgh penguins pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens geographic battle of the keystone state battle-of-the-keystone-state","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 10, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "ducks10" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 68, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "bruins68" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 85, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "sabres85" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 80, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "hurricanes80" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "blueJackets9" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 59, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "flames59" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 60, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "blackhawks60" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 37, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "barons37" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 38, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "avalanche38" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 63, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "redWings63" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 33, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers33" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 86, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "laKings86" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 72, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "canadiens72" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 110, "losses": 94, "opponentWins": "devils110" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 12, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "predators12" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 134, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "islanders134" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 121, "losses": 119, "opponentWins": "nyRangers121" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 43, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "senators43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 45, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "coyotes45" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 151, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "penguins151" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks14" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 87, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "blues87" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 93, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs93" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 71, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "canucks71" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 39, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets39" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 110, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "capitals110" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Flyers–Penguins rivalry, also known as the Battle of Pennsylvania, is a rivalry between the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey clubs in the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League (NHL).

The two basketball teams have played each other every year since the Bulls first joined the NBA in 1966. However, the rivalry began to grow in intensity during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when both teams became huge playoff contenders. This was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams. The two teams met in the playoffs seven times between 1981 and 1996, with the Bulls winning six of those series. They have not met in the playoffs since 1996. The rivalry was somewhat revived when the Bulls traded Chicago native and former MVP Derrick Rose to the Knicks and New York signed former Bulls all-star Joakim Noah in the off-season of 2016.","number":"47"},{"team":"Chicago Bulls","teamLocation":"Chicago","teamName":"Bulls","teamAbb":"CHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"53.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Detroit Pistons","opponent":"pistons","opponentWins":"pistons143","league":"NBA","wins":"126","oWins":"125","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"125","oLosses":"126","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"25818","oFor":"25836","against":"25836","oAgainst":"25818","gamesPlayed":"251","leagueLower":"nba","sport":"Basketball","colour":"#669933","city":"Chicago, IL","stateAbb":"IL","state":"Illinois","country":"United States","lat":"41.88","lng":"-87.67","illX":"273.70","illY":"458.51","cBack":"#CE1141","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#000000","ocBack":"#006BB6","ocOutline":"#ED174C","ocText":"#001F70","teamSmall":"bulls","bothTeamsBackwards":"pistons-bulls","bothTeams":"bulls-pistons","oldID":"bulls126","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nba basketball  chicago-bulls chi   il illinois united-states ","class":"nba basketball  chicago-bulls chi   il illinois united-states  bulls-pistons pistons  nba basketball  detroit-pistons det detroit pistons mi michigan united-states  divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Atlanta Hawks", "wins": 123, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "hawks123" }, { "opponent": "Boston Celtics", "wins": 101, "losses": 118, "opponentWins": "celtics101" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Nets", "wins": 90, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "nets90" }, { "opponent": "Charlotte Hornets", "wins": 64, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "hornets64" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Cavaliers", "wins": 119, "losses": 85, "opponentWins": "cavaliers119" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Mavericks", "wins": 34, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "mavericks34" }, { "opponent": "Denver Nuggets", "wins": 40, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "nuggets40" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Pistons", "wins": 126, "losses": 125, "opponentWins": "pistons126" }, { "opponent": "Golden State Warriors", "wins": 83, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "warriors83" }, { "opponent": "Houston Rockets", "wins": 68, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "rockets68" }, { "opponent": "Indiana Pacers", "wins": 95, "losses": 83, "opponentWins": "pacers95" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Clippers", "wins": 65, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "clippers65" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Lakers", "wins": 63, "losses": 87, "opponentWins": "lakers63" }, { "opponent": "Memphis Grizzlies", "wins": 22, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "grizzlies22" }, { "opponent": "Miami Heat", "wins": 56, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "heat56" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Bucks", "wins": 128, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "bucks128" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Timberwolves", "wins": 31, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "timberwolves31" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Pelicans", "wins": 20, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "pelicans20" }, { "opponent": "New York Knicks", "wins": 118, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "knicks118" }, { "opponent": "Oklahoma City Thunder", "wins": 72, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "thunder72" }, { "opponent": "Orlando Magic", "wins": 52, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "magic52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia 76ers", "wins": 102, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "seventySixers102" }, { "opponent": "Phoenix Suns", "wins": 68, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "suns68" }, { "opponent": "Portland Trail Blazers", "wins": 61, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "trailblazers61" }, { "opponent": "Sacramento Kings", "wins": 79, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "sKings79" }, { "opponent": "San Antonio Spurs", "wins": 33, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "spurs33" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Raptors", "wins": 46, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "raptors46" }, { "opponent": "Utah Jazz", "wins": 51, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "jass51" }, { "opponent": "Washington Wizards", "wins": 117, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "wizards117" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Bulls–Pistons rivalry is an NBA rivalry between the Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons.

The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in the National Football League&apos;s Eagles–Giants rivalry, the National Basketball Association&apos;s Knicks–76ers rivalry, and the Major League Baseball&apos;s Mets–Phillies rivalry.","number":"115"},{"team":"Winnipeg Bluebombers","teamLocation":"Winnipeg","teamName":"Bluebombers","teamAbb":"WPG WIN","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"55.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Banjo Bowl","opponentTeam":"Saskatchewan Roughriders","opponent":"roughriders","opponentWins":"roughriders91","league":"CFL","wins":"132","oWins":"103","ties":"4","oTies":"4","losses":"103","oLosses":"132","otLosses":"1","oOtLosses":"1","for":"4861","oFor":"4537","against":"4537","oAgainst":"4861","gamesPlayed":"239","leagueLower":"cfl","sport":"Canadian Football","colour":"#61b8da","city":"Winnipeg, MB","stateAbb":"MB","state":"Manitoba","country":"Canada","lat":"49.81","lng":"-97.14","illX":"317.95","illY":"133.47","cBack":"#b9975b","cOutline":"#003087","cText":"#ffffff","ocBack":"#010101","ocOutline":"#006341","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"blueBlombers","bothTeamsBackwards":"roughriders-blueBlombers","bothTeams":"blueBlombers-roughriders","oldID":"blueBlombers132","extraClass":"bombers winnipeg-bombers blue-bombers","oldClass":"cfl canadian football  winnipeg-bluebombers wpg win winnipeg bluebombers mb manitoba canada bombers winnipeg-bombers bombers winnipeg-bombers blue-bombers","class":"cfl canadian football  winnipeg-bluebombers wpg win winnipeg bluebombers mb manitoba canada bombers winnipeg-bombers bombers winnipeg-bombers blue-bombers blueBlombers-roughriders roughriders bombers winnipeg-bombers blue-bombers cfl canadian football  saskatchewan-roughriders sa sas sask saskatchewan roughriders sk saskatchewan canada riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders rough-riders geographic banjo bowl banjo-bowl","info":[ { "opponent": "BC (Since 1954)", "wins": 88, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "bcLions88" }, { "opponent": "Calgary (Since 1945)", "wins": 90, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "stampeders90" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton (Since 1949)", "wins": 86, "losses": 101, "opponentWins": "eskimos86" }, { "opponent": "Hamilton (Since 1909)", "wins": 62, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "tigerCats62" }, { "opponent": "Montreal (Since 1946)", "wins": 42, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "allouettes42" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa (Since 1909)", "wins": 42, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "redblacks42" }, { "opponent": "Saskatchewan (Since 1910)", "wins": 132, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "roughriders132" }, { "opponent": "Toronto (Since 1909)", "wins": 54, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "argonauts54" }, { "opponent": "Other", "wins": 50, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "other50" }, { "opponent": "USA", "wins": 9, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "usa9" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Toronto—Hamilton Classic is one of the components of the Harold Ballard Trophy, an award given to the winner of the season series between the Tiger-Cats and Argonauts.

Westwood was quoted in the media as saying that people from Regina were &apos;a bunch of banjo-pickin' inbreds.&apos; He later apologized halfheartedly for those comments, saying that &apos;the vast majority of the people in Saskatchewan have no idea how to play the banjo.&apos; This further fueled the Winnipeg–Saskatchewan football rivalry and has made the rematch game even more of an event. The game is sponsored by the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation. The game has been sold out every year since 2005.

The Rockies serve as not only a geographical barrier but a political one as well: Vancouver is a haven for the political left in Canada, strongly supportive of both the Liberal and New Democratic

The rivalry really heated up in the 90&apos;s. In 1991, the Blues would defeat the Red Wings in 7 games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3–1 deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996–98; all three, which the Red Wings won. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3–2 advantage and it looked like the Blues would upset the Wings in Game 6, but the Wings would win the last two games including a double overtime victory in Game 7. This would also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season. They met during the playoffs in 2002 in the conference semifinals. The Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games as part of their 2002 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry instantly died in the post lockout as the Blues entered a slump, only reviving as the teams fought for the Central Division title in the 2011–12 season. The rivalry died, however, after Detroit moved to the Eastern Conference during the 2013 realignment.","number":"97"},{"team":"Buffalo Sabres","teamLocation":"Buffalo","teamName":"Sabres","teamAbb":"BUF","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"58.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Boston Bruins","opponent":"bruins","opponentWins":"bruins116","league":"NHL","wins":"121","oWins":"133","ties":"29","oTies":"29","losses":"118","oLosses":"110","otLosses":"15","oOtLosses":"11","for":"899","oFor":"912","against":"912","oAgainst":"899","gamesPlayed":"283","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Buffalo, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"42.88","lng":"-78.88","illX":"1045.29","illY":"445.89","cBack":"#002D62","cOutline":"#A7A9AC","cText":"#FDB930","ocBack":"#000000","ocOutline":"#FDB930","ocText":"#FDB930","teamSmall":"sabres","bothTeamsBackwards":"bruins-sabres","bothTeams":"sabres-bruins","oldID":"sabres121","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  buffalo-sabres buf buffalo sabres ny new york united-states ","class":"nhl ice hockey  buffalo-sabres buf buffalo sabres ny new york united-states  sabres-bruins bruins  nhl ice hockey  boston-bruins bos boston bruins ma massachusetts united-states  divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "ducks16" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 121, "losses": 118, "opponentWins": "bruins121" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 102, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "hurricanes102" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 9, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "blueJackets9" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 51, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames51" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 53, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "blackhawks53" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 25, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "barons25" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 60, "losses": 55, "opponentWins": "avalanche60" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 55, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "dStars55" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "redWings55" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 24, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "oilers24" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 58, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "laKings58" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 9, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "wild9" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 124, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "canadiens124" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 74, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "devils74" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators8" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 79, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "islanders79" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 80, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "nyRangers80" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 63, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "senators63" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 66, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "flyers66" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 44, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "coyotes44" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 65, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "penguins65" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 23, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "sharks23" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 45, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "blues45" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 52, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "lightning52" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 111, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs111" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 48, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "canucks48" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 25, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "wJets25" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 87, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "capitals87" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Bruins and Sabres have had a rivalry since the Sabres joined the NHL back in 1970.

The Sabres, who won the Northeast Division with 100 points and were seeded 3rd in the Eastern Conference, were upset by the 6th seeded Bruins in six games.

The two basketball teams have played each other every year since the Bulls first joined the NBA in 1966. However, the rivalry began to grow in intensity during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when both teams became huge playoff contenders. This was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams. The two teams met in the playoffs seven times between 1981 and 1996, with the Bulls winning six of those series. They have not met in the playoffs since 1996. The rivalry was somewhat revived when the Bulls traded Chicago native and former MVP Derrick Rose to the Knicks and New York signed former Bulls all-star Joakim Noah in the off-season of 2016.","number":"47"},{"team":"Philadelphia Flyers","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Flyers","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"63.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"Battle of the Broads","opponentTeam":"New York Rangers","opponent":"nyRangers","opponentWins":"nyRangers127","league":"NHL","wins":"121","oWins":"128","ties":"37","oTies":"37","losses":"119","oLosses":"113","otLosses":"9","oOtLosses":"8","for":"840","oFor":"847","against":"847","oAgainst":"840","gamesPlayed":"286","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"984.40","illY":"1125.50","cBack":"#F4793E","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#0161AB","ocOutline":"#E51837","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"flyers","bothTeamsBackwards":"nyRangers-flyers","bothTeams":"flyers-nyRangers","oldID":"flyers121","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly","class":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly flyers-nyRangers nyRangers philly nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr new york rangers ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny ny-rangers ny divisional battle of the broads battle-of-the-broads","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 10, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "ducks10" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 68, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "bruins68" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 85, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "sabres85" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 80, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "hurricanes80" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "blueJackets9" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 59, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "flames59" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 60, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "blackhawks60" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 37, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "barons37" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 38, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "avalanche38" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 63, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "redWings63" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 33, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers33" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 86, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "laKings86" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 72, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "canadiens72" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 110, "losses": 94, "opponentWins": "devils110" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 12, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "predators12" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 134, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "islanders134" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 121, "losses": 119, "opponentWins": "nyRangers121" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 43, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "senators43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 45, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "coyotes45" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 151, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "penguins151" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks14" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 87, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "blues87" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 93, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs93" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 71, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "canucks71" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 39, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets39" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 110, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "capitals110" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Flyers–Rangers rivalry (also commonly referred to as Broadway versus Broad Street) is one of the most storied and well known rivalries in the National Hockey League.

The rivalry would develop in the late 80&apos;s when they had intense division battles. In 1988, the Red Wings would defeat the Blues in five games in the Norris division final. The rivalry really heated up in the 90&apos;s. In 1991, the Blues would defeat the Red Wings in 7 games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3–1 deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996–98; all three, which the Red Wings won. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3–2 advantage and it looked like the Blues would upset the Wings in Game 6, but the Wings would win the last two games including a double overtime victory in Game 7. This would also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season. They met during the playoffs in 2002 in the conference semifinals. The Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games as part of their 2002 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry instantly died in the post lockout as the Blues entered a slump, only reviving as the teams fought for the Central Division title in the 2011–12 season. The rivalry died, however, after Detroit moved to the Eastern Conference during the 2013 realignment.","number":"97"},{"team":"Buffalo Sabres","teamLocation":"Buffalo","teamName":"Sabres","teamAbb":"BUF","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"67.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of the QEW","opponentTeam":"Toronto Maple Leafs","opponent":"mapleLeafs","opponentWins":"mapleLeafs64","league":"NHL","wins":"111","oWins":"73","ties":"18","oTies":"18","losses":"65","oLosses":"100","otLosses":"8","oOtLosses":"11","for":"723","oFor":"561","against":"561","oAgainst":"723","gamesPlayed":"202","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Buffalo, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"42.88","lng":"-78.88","illX":"1045.29","illY":"445.89","cBack":"#002D62","cOutline":"#A7A9AC","cText":"#FDB930","ocBack":"#013E7F","ocOutline":"#FFFFFF","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"sabres","bothTeamsBackwards":"mapleLeafs-sabres","bothTeams":"sabres-mapleLeafs","oldID":"sabres111","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  buffalo-sabres buf   ny new york united-states ","class":"nhl ice hockey  buffalo-sabres buf   ny new york united-states  sabres-mapleLeafs mapleLeafs  nhl ice hockey  toronto-maple-leafs tor toronto maple leafs on ontario canada leafs toronto-leafs leaves leafs toronto-leafs leaves maple-leafs maple leafs mapleleafs geographic battle of the qew battle-of-the-qew","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "ducks16" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 121, "losses": 118, "opponentWins": "bruins121" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 102, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "hurricanes102" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 9, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "blueJackets9" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 51, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames51" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 53, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "blackhawks53" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 25, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "barons25" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 60, "losses": 55, "opponentWins": "avalanche60" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 55, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "dStars55" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "redWings55" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 24, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "oilers24" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 58, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "laKings58" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 9, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "wild9" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 124, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "canadiens124" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 74, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "devils74" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators8" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 79, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "islanders79" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 80, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "nyRangers80" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 63, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "senators63" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 66, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "flyers66" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 44, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "coyotes44" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 65, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "penguins65" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 23, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "sharks23" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 45, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "blues45" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 52, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "lightning52" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 111, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs111" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 48, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "canucks48" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 25, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "wJets25" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 87, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "capitals87" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry between the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs is due to the close proximity of the two cites and their connection via the Queen Elizabeth Way highway.

They were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the dominant squad in their inaugural season, finishing with 39 wins and 92 points and making it to the Stanley Cup semifinals. The following year the Oilers became the dominant franchise when the Oilers shot to the top of the Smythe Division and Wayne Gretzky started to shatter NHL records (including his own).<BR><BR>The rivalry was especially bitter in the second half of the 1980s. For much of this time, the Oilers and Flames were the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and by some accounts in the entire league. One of the two teams represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals for eight consecutive years from 1983 to 1990 (Oilers 6 times, Flames twice). During this time, the Oilers and Flames won each Stanley Cup between 1984 and 1990, with the exception of 1986, when the Flames lost to the Montreal Canadiens. The Oilers won five of those seven cups, a feat that has not been repeated since. They are recognized as the NHL&apos;s last dynasty, with lineups that featured legends like Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, and Mark Messier. The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in 1989, led by superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour and Mike Vernon. This was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they face each other in the first or second round rather than in the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that the other two playoff qualifiers from the Smythe would have to get past either the Oilers or Flames – or both – to make the conference finals. Also, the Stanley Cup was awarded in the province from 1984 to 1988.<BR><BR>The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991, on their way to two of their five Stanley Cups. The Flames defeated the Oilers in the 1986 NHL playoffs; game 7 was decided by rookie Oiler defenceman Steve Smith accidentally scoring on his own goal (credited to Perry Berezan), which ignited the rivalry to a new level. The Flames were favored in the 1988 playoffs, having won the Presidents&apos; Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup. 1991 was the last year the teams met in the playoffs, when Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game and seventh goal of the series.<BR><BR>Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a &apos;Death Valley&apos; for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those from the Wales Conference.<BR><BR>With the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would make only brief appearances during the regular season. At this time, both franchises were facing financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league. Indeed, many experts were predicting the demise of all Canadian teams except the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks. These fears were proved partially justified, as both the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets relocated to American cities, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.<BR><BR>It took well over a decade for either team to return to anything near the form they had exhibited in the 1980s. The Flames advanced to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, falling in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Flames became the first team in the modern era of the NHL to defeat all three division winners en route to the Stanley Cup final. The next Stanley Cup final, (played in 2006 due to the NHL lockout of 2005) saw the Edmonton Oilers fall in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes. The Oilers became the first 8th seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to the Stanley Cup final. However, the Oilers have not returned to the playoffs since then. The Flames would make the playoffs every year until 2009, but would then go six years without a playoff berth.<BR><BR>The 2009–10 NHL season marked the first time either team has won every game between the two, the Flames were 6-0 in regular season games against the Oilers. This wasn&apos;t the first time the season series was a lopsided affair. The Oilers defeated the Flames 7 times in the 1983–84 season series and 6 times in 1984–85 and 1985–86. The 2009–10 NHL season also marked the first-ever trade between the two rivals, with Steve Staios (then of Edmonton) and Aaron Johnson (then of Calgary) switching teams on March 3, 2010.","number":"100"},{"team":"New York Knicks","teamLocation":"New

Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was &apos;as combustible as any in the league&apos;.<br><br>The rivalry gave Miller the nickname &apos;The Knick-Killer&apos;.

In total, the two teams have met nine times in the playoffs. Despite trailing in 8 of the 9 series, Pittsburgh has won all but the 1994 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals where they were heavily favored. The teams first met in the 1991 Patrick Division Finals, when the Penguins defeated the Capitals in 5 en route to capturing the Stanley Cup. In fact, all four league titles won by Pittsburgh have included a round against Washington. The rivalry was intense during the early 2000s when the Penguins beat the Capitals in the first round in consecutive seasons (1999-00, 2000–01), and seemed to amplify more after the trade of Jaromir Jagr.<BR><BR>More recently, with the drafting and emergence of Alexander Ovechkin in Washington, and Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, the rivalry has heated up again, with controversial comments that Alexander Semin made about Crosby in the media and physical altercations taking place between Ovechkin and Malkin during games. One of the best series to date between the teams was the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which the Capitals took a 2–0 series lead before letting it go once again to be downed in 7 games, ending with a 6–2 Game 7 loss at the Verizon Center. Just like in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins defeated the Capitals in the playoffs en route to the Stanley Cup. The two teams faced off at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic hosted in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, with the Capitals emerging victorious 3–1. The Capitals and Penguins completed their second playoff confrontation in the Ovechkin-Crosby era in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs with the Penguins winning in six games, again preceding Pittsburgh&apos;s fourth Stanley Cup title.","number":"119"},{"team":"New Jersey Devils","teamLocation":"New Jersey","teamName":"Devils","teamAbb":"NJ","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"71.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"Battle of the Jersey Turnpike","opponentTeam":"Philadelphia Flyers","opponent":"flyers","opponentWins":"flyers104","league":"NHL","wins":"105","oWins":"110","ties":"18","oTies":"18","losses":"104","oLosses":"94","otLosses":"6","oOtLosses":"11","for":"689","oFor":"766","against":"766","oAgainst":"689","gamesPlayed":"233","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Newark, NJ","stateAbb":"NJ","state":"New Jersey","country":"United States","lat":"40.73","lng":"-74.17","illX":"1083.74","illY":"875.29","cBack":"#E03A3E","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#F4793E","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"devils","bothTeamsBackwards":"flyers-devils","bothTeams":"devils-flyers","oldID":"devils105","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-jersey-devils nj new jersey devils nj new jersey united-states ","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-jersey-devils nj new jersey devils nj new jersey united-states  devils-flyers flyers  nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi philadelphia flyers pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly divisional battle of the jersey turnpike battle-of-the-jersey-turnpike","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 17, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "ducks17" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 50, "losses": 74, "opponentWins": "bruins50" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 59, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "sabres59" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 71, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "hurricanes71" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 12, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets12" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 25, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "flames25" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 39, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "blackhawks39" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "barons6" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 35, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche35" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 43, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "dStars43" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 39, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "redWings39" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 32, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "oilers32" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 52, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "panthers52" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 35, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "laKings35" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wild12" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 65, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "canadiens65" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 14, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "predators14" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 86, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "islanders86" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 97, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "nyRangers97" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 105, "losses": 104, "opponentWins": "flyers105" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 26, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "coyotes26" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 111, "losses": 93, "opponentWins": "penguins111" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 19, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "sharks19" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 37, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "blues37" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 55, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "lightning55" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 48, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs48" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 35, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "canucks35" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 32, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "wJets32" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 87, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "capitals87" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Devils–Flyers rivalry is a rivalry between two teams in the NHL&apos;s Metropolitan Division.

The Rockies serve as not only a geographical barrier but a political one as well: Vancouver is a haven for the political left in Canada, strongly supportive of both the Liberal and New Democratic

In 1988, the Capitals trailed the Flyers three games to one in the opening round of the playoffs. Washington would rally to win the next three games to take the series in seven games capped off by Dale Hunter&apos;s overtime goal in game seven. The following year, Tim Kerr and Ron Hextall helped the Flyers take down the division champions Capitals.<BR><BR>In the 2000s, the rivalry was reignited by the rebirth of the Alexander Ovechkin-led Capitals, whom the Flyers eliminated in 2008. Since the league-wide realignment in 2013, the rivalry between the teams has started to intensify. During a regular season game in 2013, there was an all-out line-brawl between the two teams.

Association (NBA) teams, the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Both teams compete in Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The New York Knicks were established in 1946 as one of the charter franchises of the NBA, and have been based at Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan since 1968. The Nets were established in 1967 as a member of the now-defunct American Basketball Association, and joined the NBA in 1976. They have been based at Barclays Center in Brooklyn since 2012, though have played in the New York metropolitan area their entire existence.<BR><BR>The rivalry began in 1976 when the Nets joined the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger. At the time, the team was known as the New York Nets and played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Long Island. The team became the New Jersey Nets the following season when they relocated to suburban New Jersey, playing temporarily in Piscataway before moving to Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford in 1981, their home until 2010.

They were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the dominant squad in their inaugural season, finishing with 39 wins and 92 points and making it to the Stanley Cup semifinals. The following year the Oilers became the dominant franchise when the Oilers shot to the top of the Smythe Division and Wayne Gretzky started to shatter NHL records (including his own).<BR><BR>The rivalry was especially bitter in the second half of the 1980s. For much of this time, the Oilers and Flames were the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and by some accounts in the entire league. One of the two teams represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals for eight consecutive years from 1983 to 1990 (Oilers 6 times, Flames twice). During this time, the Oilers and Flames won each Stanley Cup between 1984 and 1990, with the exception of 1986, when the Flames lost to the Montreal Canadiens. The Oilers won five of those seven cups, a feat that has not been repeated since. They are recognized as the NHL&apos;s last dynasty, with lineups that featured legends like Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, and Mark Messier. The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in 1989, led by superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour and Mike Vernon. This was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they face each other in the first or second round rather than in the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that the other two playoff qualifiers from the Smythe would have to get past either the Oilers or Flames – or both – to make the conference finals. Also, the Stanley Cup was awarded in the province from 1984 to 1988.<BR><BR>The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991, on their way to two of their five Stanley Cups. The Flames defeated the Oilers in the 1986 NHL playoffs; game 7 was decided by rookie Oiler defenceman Steve Smith accidentally scoring on his own goal (credited to Perry Berezan), which ignited the rivalry to a new level. The Flames were favored in the 1988 playoffs, having won the Presidents&apos; Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup. 1991 was the last year the teams met in the playoffs, when Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game and seventh goal of the series.<BR><BR>Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a &apos;Death Valley&apos; for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those from the Wales Conference.<BR><BR>With the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would make only brief appearances during the regular season. At this time, both franchises were facing financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league. Indeed, many experts were predicting the demise of all Canadian teams except the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks. These fears were proved partially justified, as both the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets relocated to American cities, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.<BR><BR>It took well over a decade for either team to return to anything near the form they had exhibited in the 1980s. The Flames advanced to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, falling in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Flames became the first team in the modern era of the NHL to defeat all three division winners en route to the Stanley Cup final. The next Stanley Cup final, (played in 2006 due to the NHL lockout of 2005) saw the Edmonton Oilers fall in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes. The Oilers became the first 8th seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to the Stanley Cup final. However, the Oilers have not returned to the playoffs since then. The Flames would make the playoffs every year until 2009, but would then go six years without a playoff berth.<BR><BR>The 2009–10 NHL season marked the first time either team has won every game between the two, the Flames were 6-0 in regular season games against the Oilers. This wasn&apos;t the first time the season series was a lopsided affair. The Oilers defeated the Flames 7 times in the 1983–84 season series and 6 times in 1984–85 and 1985–86. The 2009–10 NHL season also marked the first-ever trade between the two rivals, with Steve Staios (then of Edmonton) and Aaron Johnson (then of Calgary) switching teams on March 3, 2010.","number":"100"},{"team":"Chicago

That title goes to the Lions–Packers rivalry, who have played each other at least twice a year since 1932. Also one meeting between the Bears and Lions was canceled in 1987 due to another strike.)

the first time in the 1990 Playoffs, the Pistons swept the Pacers in three straight games on their way to their second straight NBA championship. But the rivalry truly began in the 2003–04 season. The Pacers finished with a league best 61 wins and were led by Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Reggie Miller, and coached by Rick Carlisle. Carlisle had been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, and Richard Hamilton, and coached by Larry Brown. Indiana won the first 3 matchups in the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit.<BR><BR>They met in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana narrowly won Game 1, thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed, unimpressed, stated &apos;We will win Game 2&apos; during an interview before the second game (locally known as the &apos;Guaran-Sheed&apos; victory). Late in Game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of Game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4-2, and went on to win the NBA title.<BR><BR>On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, what has become known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl took place. All involved were suspended for varying lengths. Artest was suspended for the rest of the season (73 games).<BR><BR>That year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the Eastern Conference semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers, blew an 18-point lead, but still won Game 3 in Indianapolis. However, just as he did a year earlier, Rasheed promised a win in Game 4, saying, &apos;When we return, we will be tied at 2.&apos; The Pistons won Games 4 and 5. The Pacers, knowing a loss would lead to Miller's retirement, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons 88–79.","number":"49"},{"team":"Chicago

The rivalry caught fire when these two teams meet in the Western Conference Finals. The Kings were the defending champions, but their hopes of repeating were dashed as the Hawks would down the Kings in double overtime in game 5. In 2014, the reverse happened; the Blackhawks were defending champs, but the Kings would crush their dreams for a repeat in game 7 also in OT after building a 3–1 series lead.","number":"91"},{"team":"Saskatchewan Roughriders","teamLocation":"Saskatchewan","teamName":"Roughriders","teamAbb":"SA SAS SASK","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"91.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Banjo Bowl","opponentTeam":"Winnipeg Bluebombers","opponent":"blueBlombers","opponentWins":"blueBlombers126","league":"CFL","wins":"103","oWins":"132","ties":"4","oTies":"4","losses":"132","oLosses":"103","otLosses":"1","oOtLosses":"1","for":"4537","oFor":"4861","against":"4861","oAgainst":"4537","gamesPlayed":"239","leagueLower":"cfl","sport":"Canadian Football","colour":"#61b8da","city":"Regina, SK","stateAbb":"SK","state":"Saskatchewan","country":"Canada","lat":"50.45","lng":"-104.62","illX":"263.19","illY":"48.65","cBack":"#010101","cOutline":"#006341","cText":"#ffffff","ocBack":"#b9975b","ocOutline":"#003087","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"roughriders","bothTeamsBackwards":"blueBlombers-roughriders","bothTeams":"roughriders-blueBlombers","oldID":"roughriders103","extraClass":"riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders rough-riders","oldClass":"cfl canadian football  saskatchewan-roughriders sa sas sask saskatchewan roughriders sk saskatchewan canada riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders rough-riders","class":"cfl canadian football  saskatchewan-roughriders sa sas sask saskatchewan roughriders sk saskatchewan canada riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders rough-riders roughriders-blueBlombers blueBlombers riders sask regina saskatchewan-riders rough-riders cfl canadian football  winnipeg-bluebombers wpg win winnipeg bluebombers mb manitoba canada bombers winnipeg-bombers bombers winnipeg-bombers blue-bombers geographic banjo bowl banjo-bowl","info":[ { "opponent": "BC (Since 1954)", "wins": 95, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "bcLions95" }, { "opponent": "Calgary (Since 1945)", "wins": 89, "losses": 127, "opponentWins": "stampeders89" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton (Since 1949)", "wins": 92, "losses": 121, "opponentWins": "eskimos92" }, { "opponent": "Hamilton (Since 1909)", "wins": 44, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "tigerCats44" }, { "opponent": "Montreal (Since 1946)", "wins": 32, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "allouettes32" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa (Since 1909)", "wins": 42, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "redBlacks42" }, { "opponent": "Toronto (Since 1909)", "wins": 48, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "argonauts48" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg (Since 1913)", "wins": 103, "losses": 132, "opponentWins": "blueBlombers103" }, { "opponent": "Other", "wins": 45, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "other45" }, { "opponent": "USA", "wins": 5, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "usa5" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Toronto—Hamilton Classic is one of the components of the Harold Ballard Trophy, an award given to the winner of the season series between the Tiger-Cats and Argonauts.

Late in Game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of Game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4-2, and went on to win the NBA title.<BR><BR>On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, what has become known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl took place. All involved were suspended for varying lengths. Artest was suspended for the rest of the season (73 games).<BR><BR>That year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the Eastern Conference semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers, blew an 18-point lead, but still won Game 3 in Indianapolis. However, just as he did a year earlier, Rasheed promised a win in Game 4, saying, &apos;When we return, we will be tied at 2.&apos; The Pistons won Games 4 and 5. The Pacers, knowing a loss would lead to Miller's retirement, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons 88–79.","number":"49"},{"team":"New York Islanders","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Islanders","teamAbb":"NYI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"93.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Washington Capitals","opponent":"capitals","opponentWins":"capitals89","league":"NHL","wins":"91","oWins":"103","ties":"13","oTies":"13","losses":"89","oLosses":"85","otLosses":"14","oOtLosses":"6","for":"676","oFor":"650","against":"650","oAgainst":"676","gamesPlayed":"207","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Brooklyn, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.68","lng":"-73.98","illX":"1305.47","illY":"758.70","cBack":"#00529B","cOutline":"#F57D31","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#002147","ocOutline":"#C60C30","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"islanders","bothTeamsBackwards":"capitals-islanders","bothTeams":"islanders-capitals","oldID":"islanders91","extraClass":"ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-islanders nyi   ny new york united-states ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-islanders nyi   ny new york united-states ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles islanders-capitals capitals ny ny-islanders brooklyn brooklyn-islanders isles ny-isles new-york isles nhl ice hockey  washington-capitals wsh washington capitals dc district of columbia united-states caps washington-caps caps washington-caps divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 16, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "ducks16" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 56, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "bruins56" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 65, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "sabres65" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 56, "losses": 63, "opponentWins": "hurricanes56" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 12, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets12" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 49, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "flames49" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 41, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "blackhawks41" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 15, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "barons15" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 53, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "dStars53" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 50, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "redWings50" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 29, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "oilers29" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 37, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "panthers37" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 45, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "laKings45" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 10, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "wild10" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 58, "losses": 86, "opponentWins": "canadiens58" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 127, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "devils127" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 9, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "predators9" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 116, "losses": 119, "opponentWins": "nyRangers116" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 26, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "senators26" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 99, "losses": 128, "opponentWins": "flyers99" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 36, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "coyotes36" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 105, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "penguins105" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 16, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "sharks16" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 51, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "blues51" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 74, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs74" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 52, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "canucks52" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 32, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "wJets32" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 91, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "capitals91" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Capitals and Islanders were rivals during the 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1983 and 1987, the two teams met in the playoffs with the Islanders winning each series except 1986. The Islanders won the Division semifinals 3–1 in 1983, the Division Finals 4–1 in 1984, and the Division semifinals 3–2 after being down two games in 1985. The Capitals defeated the Islanders in 1986 in a three-game sweep.<BR><BR>In 1987, the teams had one of the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Islanders forced Game 7 after being down 3–1 in the series. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for New York and Bob Mason for Washington went at it save for save, stopping every scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3–2 victory and a 4–3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic.<BR><BR>Six years later in 1993, the teams met once again, the Capitals finished second in the division with 93 points, six points ahead of the Islanders. Washington won the opener by a score of 3–1, before the Islanders won the next three games, all in overtime, including a pair in double OT to take a 3–1 series lead. Washington won game five to stave off elimination, but in game six, the Islanders won 5–3 to take the series in six. But, the win came at a price as Pierre Turgeon suffered a shoulder injury of a vicious check by Washington&apos;s Dale Hunter after scoring a goal to put the game and series out of reach. As a result, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season.<BR><BR>Both teams met in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, with Washington winning the series four games to three.","number":"112"},{"team":"Edmonton Oilers","teamLocation":"Edmonton","teamName":"Oilers","teamAbb":"EDM","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"94.00","rivalryType":"expansion","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Kings","opponent":"laKings","opponentWins":"laKings77","league":"NHL","wins":"89","oWins":"81","ties":"30","oTies":"30","losses":"78","oLosses":"80","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"9","for":"766","oFor":"720","against":"720","oAgainst":"766","gamesPlayed":"200","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Edmonton, AB","stateAbb":"AB","state":"Alberta","country":"Canada","lat":"53.55","lng":"-113.50","illX":"57.57","illY":"125.00","cBack":"#013E7F","cOutline":"#EB6E1E","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#B2B7BB","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"oilers","bothTeamsBackwards":"laKings-oilers","bothTeams":"oilers-laKings","oldID":"oilers89","extraClass":"oil","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  edmonton-oilers edm   ab alberta canada oil oil","class":"nhl ice hockey  edmonton-oilers edm   ab alberta canada oil oil oilers-laKings laKings oil nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak los angeles kings ca california united-states la-kings la la-kings la expansion  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 42, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "ducks42" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 20, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "bruins20" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 39, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "sabres39" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 38, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "hurricanes38" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 31, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "blueJackets31" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 95, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "flames95" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 54, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "blackhawks54" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 74, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "avalanche74" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 47, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "dStars47" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 49, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "redWings49" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 15, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "panthers15" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 89, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "laKings89" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 31, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "wild31" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 38, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "canadiens38" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 35, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "devils35" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 26, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "predators26" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 30, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "islanders30" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 32, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "nyRangers32" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 17, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "senators17" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 31, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "flyers31" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 100, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "coyotes100" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 38, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "penguins38" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 48, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "sharks48" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 54, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "blues54" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 18, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "lightning18" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 43, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs43" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 116, "losses": 83, "opponentWins": "canucks116" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 13, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wJets13" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 30, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "capitals30" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry between the Edmonton Oilers and the Los Angeles Kings began more or less the instant the Oilers began playing in the NHL in the 1979–80 season. Among the first-year Oilers&apos; players included a young Wayne Gretzky, who instantly challenged for the Art Ross Trophy against the Kings&apos; Marcel Dionne. In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky&apos;s 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne&apos;s full count of 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught &apos;that an assist was good as a goal.&apos;<BR><BR>The two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981–82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists). The Oilers also jumped to the top of their division despite playing in their third NHL season and had the third best record in the league. The Kings, after a fairly impressive 1980–81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL. They only made the playoffs, being fourth in the same division as the Oilers, because the Colorado Rockies had an even worse record in their last season. This set the stage for the top-seeded, heavily-favored Oilers to meet in the first round against the Kings. After a two-game split in Edmonton, Game 3 in Los Angeles began with a commanding Oilers 5–0 lead after two periods. But in a miraculous comeback, the Kings managed to tie the game 5–5 in the third period, scoring the tying goal with five seconds left on a two-man advantage. The Kings would later win the game 6–5 in overtime. This game is often referred to as the Miracle on Manchester. The Oilers struck back in Game 4 to send the series back to Edmonton for the deciding game in a best-of-five series. However, it was the Kings who upset the Oilers and advanced to the next round.<BR><BR>For the next two seasons, the Kings would miss the playoffs completely while the Oilers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983 and won their first Stanley Cup in 1984. Both finals were played against the dynasty New York Islanders. The two teams finally met again in 1985, but this time the Oilers defeated the Kings in three straight games. The Oilers would go on to win their second straight Stanley Cup. They met again in 1987 under a new best-of-seven playoff format for the first round, and again the Oilers would win, this time in five games, and again the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. In 1988, the Kings were again blown out of the first round, but by the Calgary Flames, while Gretzky led the Oilers to another Stanley Cup.<BR><BR>The entire world of sports was shocked on August 9, 1988 upon the announcement of the Oilers trading Wayne Gretzky along with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley, to the Kings for two rising young players (Jimmy Carson and Martin Gelinas), three first-round draft picks, and $15 million in US dollars.<BR><BR>Gretzky would lead the Kings in the 1988–89 season to vast improvements. For the first time, the Kings had a better season record than Edmonton, finishing second in the Smythe Division over the third place Oilers. This also led to another first round match up between the Kings and Oilers. This time, it was the Kings, with Gretzky, against the Oilers, and the Kings also had home ice. The Oilers first took command of the series and jumped ahead three games to one above the Kings. But Los Angeles answered back with three straight wins to win the series against Edmonton.<BR><BR>In the next three playoff meetings between the two teams, the Gretzky-led Kings would be eliminated by his former teammates in four, six, and six games respectively. Edmonton also won another Stanley Cup in 1990 after sweeping the Kings in the second round.<BR><BR>After the 1990–91 season, the rivalry would die down as players from the Oilers would move to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy would rejoin Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, and others would move to the New York Rangers and go on a Stanley Cup winning run in 1994. Furthermore, the two Pacific Division teams have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been regularly competitive at the same time, thus keeping what once was an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. And Edmonton has not made a postseason appearance ever since that 2006 run, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014.","number":"99"},{"team":"New York Rangers","teamLocation":"New

Between 1983 and 1987, the two teams met in the playoffs with the Islanders winning each series except 1986. The Islanders won the Division semifinals 3–1 in 1983, the Division Finals 4–1 in 1984, and the Division semifinals 3–2 after being down two games in 1985. The Capitals defeated the Islanders in 1986 in a three-game sweep.<BR><BR>In 1987, the teams had one of the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Islanders forced Game 7 after being down 3–1 in the series. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for New York and Bob Mason for Washington went at it save for save, stopping every scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3–2 victory and a 4–3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic.<BR><BR>Six years later in 1993, the teams met once again, the Capitals finished second in the division with 93 points, six points ahead of the Islanders. Washington won the opener by a score of 3–1, before the Islanders won the next three games, all in overtime, including a pair in double OT to take a 3–1 series lead. Washington won game five to stave off elimination, but in game six, the Islanders won 5–3 to take the series in six. But, the win came at a price as Pierre Turgeon suffered a shoulder injury of a vicious check by Washington&apos;s Dale Hunter after scoring a goal to put the game and series out of reach. As a result, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season.<BR><BR>Both teams met in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, with Washington winning the series four games to three.","number":"112"},{"team":"Washington Capitals","teamLocation":"Washington","teamName":"Capitals","teamAbb":"WSH","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"97.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Penguins","opponent":"penguins","opponentWins":"penguins105","league":"NHL","wins":"94","oWins":"105","ties":"16","oTies":"16","losses":"97","oLosses":"89","otLosses":"8","oOtLosses":"5","for":"756","oFor":"773","against":"773","oAgainst":"756","gamesPlayed":"215","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Washington, DC","stateAbb":"DC","state":"District of Columbia","country":"United States","lat":"38.90","lng":"-77.02","illX":"1162.16","illY":"1178.74","cBack":"#002147","cOutline":"#C60C30","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#C5B358","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"capitals","bothTeamsBackwards":"penguins-capitals","bothTeams":"capitals-penguins","oldID":"capitals94","extraClass":"caps washington-caps","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  washington-capitals wsh   dc district of columbia united-states caps washington-caps caps washington-caps","class":"nhl ice hockey  washington-capitals wsh   dc district of columbia united-states caps washington-caps caps washington-caps capitals-penguins penguins caps washington-caps nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit pittsburgh penguins pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 15, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "ducks15" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 55, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "bruins55" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 52, "losses": 82, "opponentWins": "sabres52" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 89, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "hurricanes89" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 17, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "blueJackets17" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 36, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "flames36" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 41, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "blackhawks41" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 6, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "barons6" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 40, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "avalanche40" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 29, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "dStars29" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 47, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "redWings47" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 35, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "oilers35" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 63, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "panthers63" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 36, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "laKings36" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "wild9" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 67, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "canadiens67" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 102, "losses": 74, "opponentWins": "devils102" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 13, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "predators13" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 103, "losses": 85, "opponentWins": "islanders103" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 98, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "nyRangers98" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 42, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "senators42" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 78, "losses": 101, "opponentWins": "flyers78" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 32, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "coyotes32" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 94, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "penguins94" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 11, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "sharks11" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 41, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "blues41" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 75, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "lightning75" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 69, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs69" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 43, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "canucks43" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 48, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "wJets48" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Pittsburgh Penguins–Washington Capitals rivalry was an inter-division rivalry from 1994 to 2013, and intradivisional the other seasons. In total, the two teams have met nine times in the playoffs. Despite trailing in 8 of the 9 series, Pittsburgh has won all but the 1994 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals where they were heavily favored. The teams first met in the 1991 Patrick Division Finals, when the Penguins defeated the Capitals in 5 en route to capturing the Stanley Cup. In fact, all four league titles won by Pittsburgh have included a round against Washington. The rivalry was intense during the early 2000s when the Penguins beat the Capitals in the first round in consecutive seasons (1999-00, 2000–01), and seemed to amplify more after the trade of Jaromir Jagr.<BR><BR>More recently, with the drafting and emergence of Alexander Ovechkin in Washington, and Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, the rivalry has heated up again, with controversial comments that Alexander Semin made about Crosby in the media and physical altercations taking place between Ovechkin and Malkin during games. One of the best series to date between the teams was the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which the Capitals took a 2–0 series lead before letting it go once again to be downed in 7 games, ending with a 6–2 Game 7 loss at the Verizon Center. Just like in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins defeated the Capitals in the playoffs en route to the Stanley Cup. The two teams faced off at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic hosted in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, with the Capitals emerging victorious 3–1. The Capitals and Penguins completed their second playoff confrontation in the Ovechkin-Crosby era in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs with the Penguins winning in six games, again preceding Pittsburgh&apos;s fourth Stanley Cup title.","number":"119"},{"team":"New York Giants","teamLocation":"New

The two teams met in the playoffs for five consecutive seasons (1972–76) and is regarded as one of the most bitter rivalries in the history of professional sports. Oakland leads the series 15–13.The Eagles–Giants rivalry is a rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League. The rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball&apos;s Mets–Phillies rivalry and National Hockey League&apos;s Flyers–Rangers rivalry. It is ranked by NFL Network as the #1 rivalry of all-time and Sports Illustrated has it amongst the top ten NFL rivalries of all-time at #4, and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most

This is mainly because there were three straight years of playoffs series between these teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The first seeds of the rivalry began with the realignment of the NHL in 1974, placing both teams in the newly formed Smythe Division. For two years, they battled each other for top spot and in 1977, they went down to the wire for the last playoff spot, which Chicago won on a tiebreaker by virtue of having more wins at season&apos;s end.<BR><BR>The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock surrender by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson over what he deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals.<BR><BR>They would not meet again until the 2008–09 season. The Blackhawks would eliminate the Canucks in the playoffs that season in the second round and would defeat them again the following season in the same round as part of their 2010 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry reached its peak in the 2011 playoffs, as they met for the third straight year in the first round of the playoffs that year, where the Canucks finally defeated Chicago 4–3. In this series, the Canucks took a 3–0 series only to drop the next three games. In Game 7, the Blackhawks tied it in the final minutes shorthanded, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Canucks forward Alexandre Burrows scored on a slapshot to win the series for the Canucks, as part of their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they ultimately lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The rivalry has died down since then due to the Canucks&apos; regular season play as well as a lack of playoff matches between the two teams.","number":"90"},{"team":"Philadelphia Eagles","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Eagles","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"100.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New York Giants","opponent":"nyGiants","opponentWins":"nyGiants85","league":"NFL","wins":"79","oWins":"84","ties":"2","oTies":"2","losses":"84","oLosses":"79","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"3107","oFor":"3190","against":"3190","oAgainst":"3107","gamesPlayed":"165","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"1030.99","illY":"988.88","cBack":"#003B48","cOutline":"#C0C0C0","cText":"#708090","ocBack":"#192F6B","ocOutline":"#CA001A","ocText":"#A2AAAD","teamSmall":"eagles","bothTeamsBackwards":"nyGiants-eagles","bothTeams":"eagles-nyGiants","oldID":"eagles79","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly","class":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly eagles-nyGiants nyGiants philly nfl american football  new-york-giants nyg new york giants ny new york united-states ny-giants ny ny-giants ny divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "falcons16" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 7, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "bills7" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 11, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "bears11" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 3, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bengals3" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 17, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "browns17" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "cowboys49" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "broncos7" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 16, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "lions16" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 14, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "packers14" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 4, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans4" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "colts8" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars2" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 4, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "chiefs4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 19, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "rams19" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 10, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "vikings10" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 79, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "nyGiants79" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 10, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyJets10" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "raiders6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 47, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "steelers47" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "chargers4" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks7" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "buccaneers8" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "titans7" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 74, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "redskins74" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Colts", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bColts1" }, { "opponent": "Boston Yanks", "wins": 7, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "yanks7" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Tigers", "wins": 6, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "bTigers6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 3, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "reds3" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Texans", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans1" }, { "opponent": "New York Yanks", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyYanks2" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Raiders–Steelers rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers.

The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball&apos;s Mets–Phillies rivalry and National Hockey League&apos;s Flyers–Rangers rivalry.

Among the first-year Oilers&apos; players included a young Wayne Gretzky, who instantly challenged for the Art Ross Trophy against the Kings&apos; Marcel Dionne. In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky&apos;s 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne&apos;s full count of 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught &apos;that an assist was good as a goal.&apos;<BR><BR>The two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981–82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists). The Oilers also jumped to the top of their division despite playing in their third NHL season and had the third best record in the league. The Kings, after a fairly impressive 1980–81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL. They only made the playoffs, being fourth in the same division as the Oilers, because the Colorado Rockies had an even worse record in their last season. This set the stage for the top-seeded, heavily-favored Oilers to meet in the first round against the Kings. After a two-game split in Edmonton, Game 3 in Los Angeles began with a commanding Oilers 5–0 lead after two periods. But in a miraculous comeback, the Kings managed to tie the game 5–5 in the third period, scoring the tying goal with five seconds left on a two-man advantage. The Kings would later win the game 6–5 in overtime. This game is often referred to as the Miracle on Manchester. The Oilers struck back in Game 4 to send the series back to Edmonton for the deciding game in a best-of-five series. However, it was the Kings who upset the Oilers and advanced to the next round.<BR><BR>For the next two seasons, the Kings would miss the playoffs completely while the Oilers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983 and won their first Stanley Cup in 1984. Both finals were played against the dynasty New York Islanders. The two teams finally met again in 1985, but this time the Oilers defeated the Kings in three straight games. The Oilers would go on to win their second straight Stanley Cup. They met again in 1987 under a new best-of-seven playoff format for the first round, and again the Oilers would win, this time in five games, and again the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. In 1988, the Kings were again blown out of the first round, but by the Calgary Flames, while Gretzky led the Oilers to another Stanley Cup.<BR><BR>The entire world of sports was shocked on August 9, 1988 upon the announcement of the Oilers trading Wayne Gretzky along with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley, to the Kings for two rising young players (Jimmy Carson and Martin Gelinas), three first-round draft picks, and $15 million in US dollars.<BR><BR>Gretzky would lead the Kings in the 1988–89 season to vast improvements. For the first time, the Kings had a better season record than Edmonton, finishing second in the Smythe Division over the third place Oilers. This also led to another first round match up between the Kings and Oilers. This time, it was the Kings, with Gretzky, against the Oilers, and the Kings also had home ice. The Oilers first took command of the series and jumped ahead three games to one above the Kings. But Los Angeles answered back with three straight wins to win the series against Edmonton.<BR><BR>In the next three playoff meetings between the two teams, the Gretzky-led Kings would be eliminated by his former teammates in four, six, and six games respectively. Edmonton also won another Stanley Cup in 1990 after sweeping the Kings in the second round.<BR><BR>After the 1990–91 season, the rivalry would die down as players from the Oilers would move to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy would rejoin Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, and others would move to the New York Rangers and go on a Stanley Cup winning run in 1994. Furthermore, the two Pacific Division teams have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been regularly competitive at the same time, thus keeping what once was an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. And Edmonton has not made a postseason appearance ever since that 2006 run, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014.","number":"99"},{"team":"Los Angeles Kings","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Kings","teamAbb":"LAK","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"103.00","rivalryType":"historical","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks92","league":"NHL","wins":"81","oWins":"93","ties":"17","oTies":"17","losses":"88","oLosses":"75","otLosses":"5","oOtLosses":"6","for":"573","oFor":"626","against":"626","oAgainst":"573","gamesPlayed":"191","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"34.04","lng":"-118.27","illX":"110.32","illY":"946.71","cBack":"#B2B7BB","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#ffffff","ocBack":"#C60C30","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"laKings","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-laKings","bothTeams":"laKings-blackhawks","oldID":"laKings81","extraClass":"la-kings la","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak   ca california united-states la-kings la la-kings la","class":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak   ca california united-states la-kings la la-kings la laKings-blackhawks blackhawks la-kings la nhl ice hockey  chicago-blackhawks chi chicago blackhawks il illinois united-states chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town historical  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 57, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "ducks57" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 42, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "bruins42" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 43, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "sabres43" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 35, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "hurricanes35" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 31, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "blueJackets31" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 94, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "flames94" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 81, "losses": 88, "opponentWins": "blackhawks81" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 64, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "avalanche64" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 87, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "dStars87" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 83, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "redWings83" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 81, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "oilers81" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 17, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "panthers17" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 25, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "wild25" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 32, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "canadiens32" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 54, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "devils54" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 32, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "predators32" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 47, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "islanders47" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 48, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "nyRangers48" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 19, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "senators19" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 43, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "flyers43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 86, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "coyotes86" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 74, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "penguins74" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 62, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sharks62" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 74, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "blues74" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 13, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "lightning13" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 64, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs64" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 107, "losses": 100, "opponentWins": "canucks107" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wJets12" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 57, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "capitals57" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry would start in the 1970–71 season, when the Chicago Blackhawks moved to the West Division.

It cooled down after the Hawks and the Kings were in separate divisions. It got intense in the 2012–13 lockout-shortened season, when the Blackhawks spoiled the Kings&apos; banner party on their way to one of the best starts in sports history. The rivalry caught fire when these two teams meet in the Western Conference Finals. The Kings were the defending champions, but their hopes of repeating were dashed as the Hawks would down the Kings in double overtime in game 5. In 2014, the reverse happened; the Blackhawks were defending champs, but the Kings would crush their dreams for a repeat in game 7 also in OT after building a 3–1 series

The teams most recently met in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, which the Heat won in five games.<BR><BR>The Heat–Knicks rivalry was one of the fiercest in the NBA, and Sports Illustrated considered it the third-best NBA rivalry. Prior to the 1997 NBA Playoffs, no two NBA teams had ever met in the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, with each series going to the maximum possible number of games. The aggressive nature of those four series, defensive struggles marked by numerous foul calls, and intensely physical play, can be traced to the highly defensive style of Pat Riley, former coach of both teams and the rivalries' central figure. This 1990s rivalry created some of the most highly anticipated matchups during its short-lived tenure.","number":"53"},{"team":"Chicago Bulls","teamLocation":"Chicago","teamName":"Bulls","teamAbb":"CHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"105.00","rivalryType":"league","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Miami Heat","opponent":"heat","opponentWins":"heat61","league":"NBA","wins":"56","oWins":"48","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"48","oLosses":"56","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"9958","oFor":"9872","against":"9872","oAgainst":"9958","gamesPlayed":"104","leagueLower":"nba","sport":"Basketball","colour":"#669933","city":"Chicago, IL","stateAbb":"IL","state":"Illinois","country":"United States","lat":"41.88","lng":"-87.67","illX":"273.70","illY":"458.51","cBack":"#CE1141","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#000000","ocBack":"#98002E","ocOutline":"#F9A01B","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"bulls","bothTeamsBackwards":"heat-bulls","bothTeams":"bulls-heat","oldID":"bulls56","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nba basketball  chicago-bulls chi   il illinois united-states ","class":"nba basketball  chicago-bulls chi   il illinois united-states  bulls-heat heat  nba basketball  miami-heat mia miami heat fl florida united-states  league  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Atlanta Hawks", "wins": 123, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "hawks123" }, { "opponent": "Boston Celtics", "wins": 101, "losses": 118, "opponentWins": "celtics101" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Nets", "wins": 90, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "nets90" }, { "opponent": "Charlotte Hornets", "wins": 64, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "hornets64" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Cavaliers", "wins": 119, "losses": 85, "opponentWins": "cavaliers119" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Mavericks", "wins": 34, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "mavericks34" }, { "opponent": "Denver Nuggets", "wins": 40, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "nuggets40" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Pistons", "wins": 126, "losses": 125, "opponentWins": "pistons126" }, { "opponent": "Golden State Warriors", "wins": 83, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "warriors83" }, { "opponent": "Houston Rockets", "wins": 68, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "rockets68" }, { "opponent": "Indiana Pacers", "wins": 95, "losses": 83, "opponentWins": "pacers95" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Clippers", "wins": 65, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "clippers65" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Lakers", "wins": 63, "losses": 87, "opponentWins": "lakers63" }, { "opponent": "Memphis Grizzlies", "wins": 22, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "grizzlies22" }, { "opponent": "Miami Heat", "wins": 56, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "heat56" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Bucks", "wins": 128, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "bucks128" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Timberwolves", "wins": 31, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "timberwolves31" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Pelicans", "wins": 20, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "pelicans20" }, { "opponent": "New York Knicks", "wins": 118, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "knicks118" }, { "opponent": "Oklahoma City Thunder", "wins": 72, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "thunder72" }, { "opponent": "Orlando Magic", "wins": 52, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "magic52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia 76ers", "wins": 102, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "seventySixers102" }, { "opponent": "Phoenix Suns", "wins": 68, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "suns68" }, { "opponent": "Portland Trail Blazers", "wins": 61, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "trailblazers61" }, { "opponent": "Sacramento Kings", "wins": 79, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "sKings79" }, { "opponent": "San Antonio Spurs", "wins": 33, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "spurs33" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Raptors", "wins": 46, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "raptors46" }, { "opponent": "Utah Jazz", "wins": 51, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "jass51" }, { "opponent": "Washington Wizards", "wins": 117, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "wizards117" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Bulls–Heat rivalry is an NBA rivalry between the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat.

The series takes its name from the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco.<BR><BR>Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to Cubs–White Sox, or Mets–Yankees games where animosity runs high, though more radical sections of each fanbase does harbor towards the entirety of the other. This, however, is severely limited as many people see the opposing team as no threat to their own; hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from an historical era of their franchises.<BR><BR>The series is also occasionally referred to as the &apos;BART Series&apos; for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name &apos;BART Series&apos; has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the &apos;Bay Bridge Series&apos; of the &apos;Battle of the Bay.&apos;<BR><BR>Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series which the Athletics won and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of Interleague play in 1997.

The two teams met in the postseason four years in a row from 1997–2000, with the Knicks winning three of those series and the Heat winning one. The teams most recently met in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, which the Heat won in five games.<BR><BR>The Heat–Knicks rivalry was one of the fiercest in the NBA, and Sports Illustrated considered it the third-best NBA rivalry. Prior to the 1997 NBA Playoffs, no two NBA teams had ever met in the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, with each series going to the maximum possible number of games. The aggressive nature of those four series, defensive struggles marked by numerous foul calls, and intensely physical play, can be traced to the highly defensive style of Pat Riley, former coach of both teams and the rivalries' central figure. This 1990s rivalry created some of the most highly anticipated matchups during its short-lived tenure.","number":"53"},{"team":"Dallas Cowboys","teamLocation":"Dallas","teamName":"Cowboys","teamAbb":"DAL","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"110.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Washington Redskins","opponent":"redskins","opponentWins":"redskins44","league":"NFL","wins":"68","oWins":"42","ties":"2","oTies":"2","losses":"42","oLosses":"68","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"2590","oFor":"2162","against":"2162","oAgainst":"2590","gamesPlayed":"112","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Dalls, TX","stateAbb":"TX","state":"Texas","country":"United States","lat":"32.75","lng":"-97.09","illX":"851.62","illY":"1375.23","cBack":"#0D254C","cOutline":"#87909B","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#773141","ocOutline":"#FFB612","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"cowboys","bothTeamsBackwards":"redskins-cowboys","bothTeams":"cowboys-redskins","oldID":"cowboys68","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nfl american football  dallas-cowboys dal dallas cowboys tx texas united-states ","class":"nfl american football  dallas-cowboys dal dallas cowboys tx texas united-states  cowboys-redskins redskins  nfl american football  washington-redskins was washington redskins dc district of columbia united-states skins washington-skins skins washington-skins red-skins divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 14, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "falcons14" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 1, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "ravens1" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bills6" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 9, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "cPanthers9" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "bears13" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 8, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bengals8" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 13, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "browns13" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "broncos4" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "lions12" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 13, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "packers13" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 3, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "texans3" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 10, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "colts10" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 3, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars3" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "chiefs6" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "rams13" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "vikings12" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 62, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "nyGiants62" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "nyJets7" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 5, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "raiders5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 62, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "eagles62" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "steelers16" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "chargers6" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "seahawks10" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 11, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "buccaneers11" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "titans8" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 68, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "redskins68" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Cowboys–Redskins rivalry is a rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins in the National Football League's NFC East division.

In 1961, Dallas was placed in the same division as the Redskins, and from that point on, they have played each other twice in every regular season.","number":"67"},{"team":"Vancouver Canucks","teamLocation":"Vancouver","teamName":"Canucks","teamAbb":"VAN","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"111.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks85","league":"NHL","wins":"76","oWins":"86","ties":"22","oTies":"22","losses":"80","oLosses":"67","otLosses":"6","oOtLosses":"9","for":"497","oFor":"579","against":"579","oAgainst":"497","gamesPlayed":"184","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Vancouver, BC","stateAbb":"BC","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","lat":"49.28","lng":"-123.11","illX":"28.65","illY":"252.38","cBack":"#003E7E","cOutline":"#C9C9C9","cText":"#008852","ocBack":"#C60C30","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"canucks","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-canucks","bothTeams":"canucks-blackhawks","oldID":"canucks76","extraClass":"nucks","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  vancouver-canucks van   bc british columbia canada nucks nucks","class":"nhl ice hockey  vancouver-canucks van   bc british columbia canada nucks nucks canucks-blackhawks blackhawks nucks nhl ice hockey  chicago-blackhawks chi chicago blackhawks il illinois united-states chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town manufactured  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 46, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "ducks46" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 30, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "bruins30" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 50, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "sabres50" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 36, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "hurricanes36" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 33, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "blueJackets33" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 103, "losses": 123, "opponentWins": "flames103" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 76, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "blackhawks76" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 24, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "barons24" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 69, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "avalanche69" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 71, "losses": 83, "opponentWins": "dStars71" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 62, "losses": 82, "opponentWins": "redWings62" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 97, "losses": 106, "opponentWins": "oilers97" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 14, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "panthers14" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 104, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "laKings104" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 42, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "wild42" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 31, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "canadiens31" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 57, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "devils57" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 38, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "predators38" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 42, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "islanders42" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 33, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "nyRangers33" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 21, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "senators21" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 33, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "flyers33" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 97, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "coyotes97" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 38, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "penguins38" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 53, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "sharks53" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 73, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "blues73" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 18, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "lightning18" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 63, "losses": 55, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs63" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 12, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets12" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 40, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "capitals40" } ],"rivalryNotes":"For a period of about four years between 2009 and 2013, this rivalry was considered one of the best, if not the best rivalry in the NHL. This is mainly because there were three straight years of playoffs series between these teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The first seeds of the rivalry began with the realignment of the NHL in 1974, placing both teams in the newly formed Smythe Division. For two years, they battled each other for top spot and in 1977, they went down to the wire for the last playoff spot, which Chicago won on a tiebreaker by virtue of having more wins at season&apos;s end.<BR><BR>The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock surrender by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson over what he deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals.<BR><BR>They would not meet again until the 2008–09 season. The Blackhawks would eliminate the Canucks in the playoffs that season in the second round and would defeat them again the following season in the same round as part of their 2010 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry reached its peak in the 2011 playoffs, as they met for the third straight year in the first round of the playoffs that year, where the Canucks finally defeated Chicago 4–3. In this series, the Canucks took a 3–0 series only to drop the next three games. In Game 7, the Blackhawks tied it in the final minutes shorthanded, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Canucks forward Alexandre Burrows scored on a slapshot to win the series for the Canucks, as part of their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they ultimately lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The rivalry has died down since then due to the Canucks&apos; regular season play as well as a lack of playoff matches between the two teams.","number":"90"},{"team":"Detroit Red

between the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs is due to the close proximity of the two cites and their connection via the Queen Elizabeth Way highway. The distance from the south end, the KeyBank Center from downtown Buffalo, New York, and the north end, the Air Canada Centre in downtown Toronto are 89 miles (145 kilometers) from each other. Thus Leafs-Sabres games in Buffalo are attended by large crowds of Leafs fans. Since the 1998–99 season, both teams have played in the Northeast Division, now the Atlantic Division. The teams&apos; only playoff confrontation occurred in the 1999 Eastern Conference Finals, won by Buffalo. The rivalry was added to in May, 2015, with head coach Mike Babcock signing with the Leafs (who the Sabres were close to inking a deal with the day prior).","number":"86"},{"team":"Los Angeles Clippers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Clippers","teamAbb":"LAC","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"114.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Lakers","opponent":"lakers","opponentWins":"lakers144","league":"NBA","wins":"64","oWins":"144","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"144","oLosses":"64","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"21549","oFor":"22833","against":"22833","oAgainst":"21549","gamesPlayed":"208","leagueLower":"nba","sport":"Basketball","colour":"#669933","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"34.04","lng":"-118.27","illX":"221.65","illY":"1121.49","cBack":"#ED174C","cOutline":"#006BB6","cText":"#BEC0C2","ocBack":"#552582","ocOutline":"#FDB927","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"clippers","bothTeamsBackwards":"lakers-clippers","bothTeams":"clippers-lakers","oldID":"clippers64","extraClass":"la-clippers la","oldClass":"nba basketball  los-angeles-clippers lac los angeles clippers ca california united-states la-clippers la la-clippers la","class":"nba basketball  los-angeles-clippers lac los angeles clippers ca california united-states la-clippers la la-clippers la clippers-lakers lakers la-clippers la nba basketball  los-angeles-lakers lal los angeles lakers ca california united-states la-lakers la la-lakers la geographic  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Atlanta Hawks", "wins": 40, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "hawks40" }, { "opponent": "Boston Celtics", "wins": 38, "losses": 86, "opponentWins": "celtics38" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Nets", "wins": 39, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "nets39" }, { "opponent": "Charlotte Hornets", "wins": 27, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "hornets27" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bulls", "wins": 48, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "bulls48" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Cavaliers", "wins": 50, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "cavaliers50" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Mavericks", "wins": 58, "losses": 88, "opponentWins": "mavericks58" }, { "opponent": "Denver Nuggets", "wins": 75, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "nuggets75" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Pistons", "wins": 43, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "pistons43" }, { "opponent": "Golden State Warriors", "wins": 85, "losses": 122, "opponentWins": "warriors85" }, { "opponent": "Houston Rockets", "wins": 73, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "rockets73" }, { "opponent": "Indiana Pacers", "wins": 32, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "pacers32" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Lakers", "wins": 64, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "lakers64" }, { "opponent": "Memphis Grizzlies", "wins": 41, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "grizzlies41" }, { "opponent": "Miami Heat", "wins": 22, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "heat22" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Bucks", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "bucks49" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Timberwolves", "wins": 57, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "timberwolves57" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Pelicans", "wins": 23, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "pelicans23" }, { "opponent": "New York Knicks", "wins": 55, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "knicks55" }, { "opponent": "Oklahoma City Thunder", "wins": 74, "losses": 131, "opponentWins": "thunder74" }, { "opponent": "Orlando Magic", "wins": 24, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "magic24" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia 76ers", "wins": 57, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "seventySixers57" }, { "opponent": "Phoenix Suns", "wins": 79, "losses": 130, "opponentWins": "suns79" }, { "opponent": "Portland Trail Blazers", "wins": 75, "losses": 141, "opponentWins": "trailblazers75" }, { "opponent": "Sacramento Kings", "wins": 87, "losses": 113, "opponentWins": "sKings87" }, { "opponent": "San Antonio Spurs", "wins": 37, "losses": 123, "opponentWins": "spurs37" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Raptors", "wins": 17, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "raptors17" }, { "opponent": "Utah Jazz", "wins": 75, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "jass75" }, { "opponent": "Washington Wizards", "wins": 41, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "wizards41" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers are rival teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The two Pacific Division teams both play their home games at Staples Center in Los Angeles, inspiring their matchups to sometimes be called the &apos;Hallway Series&apos;. The Lakers relocated from Minneapolis in 1960, while the Clippers moved from San Diego in 1984. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. The Lakers have won 11 of their 16 NBA championships since moving to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Clippers have made the playoffs only eight times since 1984 and were long considered the laughingstock of the NBA; in the history of the franchise, they have never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Some contended that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful. For the first time in 20 years, the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers in 2012–13. This was the first of four straight season series victories for the Clippers, which included season sweeps in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Lakers hold a 98–44 advantage in the all-time series against the Clippers.[a] The two teams have never met in the playoffs.","number":"50"},{"team":"Pittsburgh Penguins","teamLocation":"Pittsburgh","teamName":"Penguins","teamAbb":"PIT","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"115.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Detroit Red Wings","opponent":"redWings","opponentWins":"redWings65","league":"NHL","wins":"68","oWins":"65","ties":"16","oTies":"16","losses":"62","oLosses":"64","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"4","for":"523","oFor":"504","against":"504","oAgainst":"523","gamesPlayed":"149","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Pittsburgh, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"40.44","lng":"-79.99","illX":"970.31","illY":"937.58","cBack":"#C5B358","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#E51837","ocOutline":"#FFFFFF","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"penguins","bothTeamsBackwards":"redWings-penguins","bothTeams":"penguins-redWings","oldID":"penguins68","extraClass":"pens pittsburgh-pens","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens","class":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens penguins-redWings redWings pens pittsburgh-pens nhl ice hockey  detroit-red-wings det detroit red wings mi michigan united-states wings detroit-wings wings detroit-wings red-wings redwings manufactured  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 19, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "ducks19" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 67, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "bruins67" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 83, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sabres83" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 67, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "hurricanes67" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 17, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "blueJackets17" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 44, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blackhawks44" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 35, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "barons35" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 67, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "dStars67" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 68, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "redWings68" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 63, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "laKings63" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wild8" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 62, "losses": 112, "opponentWins": "canadiens62" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 98, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "devils98" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 116, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "islanders116" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 120, "losses": 115, "opponentWins": "nyRangers120" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 97, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "flyers97" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 42, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "coyotes42" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 16, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks16" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 52, "losses": 66, "opponentWins": "blues52" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 83, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs83" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 63, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks63" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 43, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets43" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 105, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "capitals105" } ],"rivalryNotes":"A much more recent rivalry, these two teams met in back-to-back Stanley Cup Finals in 2008 and 2009.

In 2009, Detroit seemed to be in control of the series after winning Game 5 5–0 to take a 3–2 series lead, but the Penguins were able to come back with 2–1 victories in Games 6 and 7 to win the Stanley Cup.

At the time, the Kings and Seals were the only two NHL teams located west of the Mississippi River (the St. Louis Blues and the Minnesota North Stars were located on that river), and thus were created for each other to both reduce the amount of travel each team would need to do and to gain a foothold on the West Coast, previously the province of the borderline-major Western Hockey League, of which the Seals had been a member. The Seals were a historically unsuccessful team and left the Bay Area in 1976; the team ceased to exist when it merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978.<BR><BR>The Kings–Sharks rivalry started in 1991, when the San Jose Sharks were spun off from the North Stars and effectively reborn under the Seals&apos; previous ownership. This rivalry really kicked things off with defeating the Wayne Gretzky era Los Angeles Kings 4–0 on April 28, 1995 destroyed any hope of a Kings playoff appearance. The Kings didn&apos;t get a definitive win over the Sharks until the 2002–03 season, when the Kings&apos; victory on February 17, 2003 at the Staples Center ended the Sharks hope of making the playoffs. The Kings and Sharks met again in the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Sharks were the 2nd seed and the Kings were the 7th seed. The Sharks would eliminate Los Angeles in six games with Joe Thornton scoring the OT goal that eliminated the Kings. In the 2011–12 NHL season, the teams competed for the last 2 seeds in the west with the Sharks ultimately securing the 7th seed while LA went into the 8th seed. San Jose would be eliminated by the St. Louis Blues in the first round while LA would steamrolled their way to their first Stanley Cup in the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals.

The Kings then rebounded to send the series back to San Jose with a 6–3 victory in Game 4 before winning on the road 3–0 in Game 5 to head back to Los Angeles. A 4–1 win in Los Angeles for the Kings brought the series to seven games, becoming just the 9th team in history to force a Game 7 after being down 0–3. Given the chance to become just the 4th team in NHL history to complete the unlikeliest of comebacks, the Kings won 5–1 in San Jose to win the series. In doing so, Mike Richards and Jeff Carter became the first NHL players to complete the comeback twice, both being part of the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers team that came back from 0–3 down to the Boston Bruins, of which Richards was captain. In February, 2015, the two teams faced off against each other in an outdoor game at Levi&apos;s Stadium in Santa Clara.

This, however, is severely limited as many people see the opposing team as no threat to their own; hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from an historical era of their franchises.<BR><BR>The series is also occasionally referred to as the &apos;BART Series&apos; for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco.

Avalanche–Red Wings rivalry was laid well before Denver even had an NHL franchise, during games between Detroit and Quebec. Once the Nordiques moved to Denver, the small rivalry still existed. Also, in a regular season game between Detroit and Montreal, the Wings scored on Patrick Roy nine times, leading to Roy demanding a trade. Roy was eventually traded to Colorado and became a huge factor in the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry was largely predicated on the competitiveness of both teams in the late &apos;90s and early 2000s. From 1996–2002, the teams met in five playoff series, three times in the Western Conference Finals. Out of those seven seasons, the teams combined to win five Stanley Cups and four Presidents&apos; Trophies. From 1995–2003, both teams, along with the Devils, reigned exclusively as Stanley Cup champions, except in 1999, which was won by the Dallas Stars (the Devils beat the Red Wings in 1995, the Avalanche beat the Devils in 2001). The rivalry died down after the 2001–02 season, with the following season having both teams falling in round one and Roy&apos;s eventual retirement. The next confrontation between the two teams was in 2008, with the Red Wings sweeping the Avalanche 4–0 on the way to the Stanley Cup. A stadium series game took place on February 27, 2016 between the two teams at Coors Field. The Red Wings won the game 5–3.","number":"95"},{"team":"Anaheim Ducks","teamLocation":"Anaheim","teamName":"Ducks","teamAbb":"ANA","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"123.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Freeway Faceoff","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Kings","opponent":"laKings","opponentWins":"laKings43","league":"NHL","wins":"61","oWins":"57","ties":"11","oTies":"11","losses":"44","oLosses":"48","otLosses":"13","oOtLosses":"13","for":"376","oFor":"353","against":"353","oAgainst":"376","gamesPlayed":"129","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Anaheim, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"33.81","lng":"-117.88","illX":"233.61","illY":"1048.61","cBack":"#000000","cOutline":"#F57D31","cText":"#B6985A","ocBack":"#B2B7BB","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"ducks","bothTeamsBackwards":"laKings-ducks","bothTeams":"ducks-laKings","oldID":"ducks61","extraClass":"mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  anaheim-ducks ana anaheim ducks ca california united-states mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks","class":"nhl ice hockey  anaheim-ducks ana anaheim ducks ca california united-states mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks ducks-laKings laKings mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak los angeles kings ca california united-states la-kings la la-kings la geographic freeway faceoff freeway-faceoff","info":[ { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 15, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bruins15" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 13, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "sabres13" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 18, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "hurricanes18" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 26, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "blueJackets26" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 53, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames53" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "blackhawks45" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 43, "losses": 63, "opponentWins": "dStars43" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 25, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "redWings25" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 54, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers54" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 13, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "panthers13" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 61, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "laKings61" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 29, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "wild29" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 14, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "canadiens14" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "devils14" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 37, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "predators37" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 12, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "islanders12" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "nyRangers16" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators16" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 16, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "flyers16" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 68, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "coyotes68" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 11, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "penguins11" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 59, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "sharks59" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 39, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "blues39" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 15, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "lightning15" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 10, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs10" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 44, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks44" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 14, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets14" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 15, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "capitals15" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Freeway Face-Off is a series of ice hockey games played between the National Hockey League (NHL)&apos;s Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings.

The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators&apos; first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators&apos; highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL&apos;s worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.<BR><BR>The Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators&apos; Eric Gryba laid out Montreal&apos;s Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators&apos; coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens&apos; coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a &apos;lack of respect.&apos; Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn&apos;t care what that &apos;bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.&apos; In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal&apos;s dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.<BR><BR>Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal&apos;s PK Subban slashed Ottawa&apos;s Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators&apos; coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa&apos;s Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal.

The series name comes from the trophy the teams play for, which was first introduced in 1989 for an annual pre-season exhibition game between the two teams, and later reintroduced in 2008. The cup is awarded to the team that wins the most games against the other in a particular season. In the event of a tie, the team holding the trophy from the previous season retains it.<BR><BR>Prior to the introduction of interleague play, the Reds and Indians had only met in spring training or other exhibition games. Because the two teams play in opposite leagues, the only chance they can meet in the postseason is in the World Series. The Ohio Cup series was originally created in 1989 and was an exhibition game between the two teams played in the state capital of Columbus at Cooper Stadium just prior to the start of the season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, from 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six. The games in Columbus were typically well-attended, with attendance topping the stadium's 15,000-seat capacity in all but one year.<BR><BR>The regular-season series began in 1997 with the start of interleague play and has been played every season since except 2002. From 1999–2001 and every season since 2004, the teams meet in two three-game series per season, one in Cincinnati and one in Cleveland. For the 2013, 2014, and 2016 seasons, two two-game series were played back-to-back at each team's home field. Through the 2016 meetings, the Indians lead the all-time regular-season series 54–45.","number":"6"},{"team":"Houston Astros","teamLocation":"Houston","teamName":"Astros","teamAbb":"HOU","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"135.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Lonestar Series","opponentTeam":"Texas Rangers","opponent":"tRangers","opponentWins":"tRangers95","league":"MLB","wins":"53","oWins":"95","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"95","oLosses":"53","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"606","oFor":"812","against":"812","oAgainst":"606","gamesPlayed":"148","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Houston, TX","stateAbb":"TX","state":"Texas","country":"United States","lat":"29.76","lng":"-95.36","illX":"918.67","illY":"1306.03","cBack":"#072854","cOutline":"#FF7F00","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#003279","ocOutline":"#BD1021","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"astros","bothTeamsBackwards":"tRangers-astros","bothTeams":"astros-tRangers","oldID":"astros53","extraClass":"","oldClass":"mlb baseball  houston-astros hou houston astros tx texas united-states ","class":"mlb baseball  houston-astros hou houston astros tx texas united-states  astros-tRangers tRangers  mlb baseball  texas-rangers tex texas rangers tx texas united-states arlington arlington geographic lonestar series lonestar-series","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 52, "losses": 68, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks52" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 322, "losses": 381, "opponentWins": "braves322" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 18, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "orioles18" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 12, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "redSox12" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 378, "losses": 333, "opponentWins": "cubs378" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 21, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "whiteSox21" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 401, "losses": 443, "opponentWins": "reds401" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 19, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "indians19" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 87, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "rockies87" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 19, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "tigers19" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 29, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "royals29" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 43, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "angels43" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 323, "losses": 388, "opponentWins": "dodgers323" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 79, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "marlins79" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 128, "losses": 114, "opponentWins": "brewers128" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 21, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "twins21" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 309, "losses": 260, "opponentWins": "mets309" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 12, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "yankees12" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 36, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "athletics36" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 277, "losses": 292, "opponentWins": "phillies277" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 342, "losses": 364, "opponentWins": "pirates342" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 312, "losses": 282, "opponentWins": "padres312" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 345, "losses": 377, "opponentWins": "sfGiants345" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 47, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "mariners47" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 329, "losses": 379, "opponentWins": "cardinals329" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 15, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "rays15" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 53, "losses": 95, "opponentWins": "tRangers53" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 18, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "blueJays18" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 243, "losses": 205, "opponentWins": "nationals243" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Lone Star Series (also, Silver Boot Series) is a Major League Baseball rivalry featuring Texas' two major league franchises, the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers.

The Marlins broke into the league in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, while the Rays had their first season in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first meeting between the two teams took place on June 22, 1998 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida during the Rays' inaugural season. Beginning with the 2012 season, when the Marlins are the home team, games are played at Marlins Park. From 1998 to 2011, the games were played at Hard Rock Stadium (as it is currently named), though it has been known by several names in its existence.<BR><BR>Currently, because the Marlins play in the National League, and the Rays in the American League, the only possible postseason matchup the teams can have is in the World Series, though this has never happened as the two teams have yet to appear in the same postseason. Both teams have had appearances in the Fall Classic, however.

The two teams have combined for six Super Bowl victories (four by the Patriots) and eight AFC Championships since 2001, while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<BR><BR>The nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were AFC East division rivals from 1970–2001 (dating prior to the Colts' move from Baltimore to Indianapolis), their intensified enmity wasn't prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed AFC South following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment. Following New England's 43–22 win in the 2013–14 playoffs the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411–351.<BR><BR>The modern matchup spanning the period of 1998–2011 was usually headlined as a contest between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003–10; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter Drew Bledsoe, and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a 2004 AFC Divisional playoff game. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007–14. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie Andrew Luck.","number":"68"},{"team":"Miami Marlins","teamLocation":"Miami","teamName":"Marlins","teamAbb":"MIA","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"139.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Citrus Series","opponentTeam":"Tampa Bay Rays","opponent":"rays","opponentWins":"rays52","league":"MLB","wins":"51","oWins":"52","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"52","oLosses":"51","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"473","oFor":"481","against":"481","oAgainst":"473","gamesPlayed":"103","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Miami, FL","stateAbb":"FL","state":"Florida","country":"United States","lat":"25.78","lng":"-80.22","illX":"1315.84","illY":"1448.27","cBack":"#000000","cOutline":"#FCDE04","cText":"#0482CC","ocBack":"#00285D","ocOutline":"#79BDEE","ocText":"#FFD700","teamSmall":"marlins","bothTeamsBackwards":"rays-marlins","bothTeams":"marlins-rays","oldID":"marlins51","extraClass":"florida-marlins","oldClass":"mlb baseball  miami-marlins mia miami marlins fl florida united-states florida-marlins florida-marlins","class":"mlb baseball  miami-marlins mia miami marlins fl florida united-states florida-marlins florida-marlins marlins-rays rays florida-marlins mlb baseball  tampa-bay-rays tb tampa bay rays fl florida united-states tampa tampa-rays devil-rays tampa-devil-rays tampa-bay-devil-rays tampa tampa-rays devil-rays tampa-devil-rays tampa-bay-devil-rays devilrays geographic citrus series citrus-series","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 59, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks59" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 166, "losses": 229, "opponentWins": "braves166" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 20, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "orioles20" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 12, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "redSox12" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 92, "losses": 93, "opponentWins": "cubs92" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 6, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "whiteSox6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 81, "losses": 107, "opponentWins": "reds81" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 9, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "indians9" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 101, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "rockies101" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 8, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "tigers8" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 78, "losses": 79, "opponentWins": "astros78" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "royals7" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "angels4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 85, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "dodgers85" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 67, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "brewers67" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "twins6" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 187, "losses": 208, "opponentWins": "mets187" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 11, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "yankees11" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "athletics5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 179, "losses": 218, "opponentWins": "phillies179" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 86, "losses": 96, "opponentWins": "pirates86" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 84, "losses": 94, "opponentWins": "padres84" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 76, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "sfGiants76" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "mariners7" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 73, "losses": 106, "opponentWins": "cardinals73" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 51, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "rays51" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "tRangers8" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 18, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJays18" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 207, "losses": 185, "opponentWins": "nationals207" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Citrus Series is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball.

The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the &apos;traditional&apos; Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.<BR><BR>The series was rarely noted by the national media during the teams' first decades of existence, probably due to both teams' long stretches of futility. However, the September 2006 match-up, which served as the Louisiana Superdome's official reopening after Hurricane Katrina, was heralded as a major milestone in New Orleans' and the Gulf Coast's recovery from the effects of the storm as well as the Saints' return to the city after their own year-long exile after the storm; the Saints later erected a statue outside the Superdome to commemorate their win in that game.<BR><BR>The late season match-ups in the 2010 and 2011 seasons held playoff implications for both teams. Games between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years; fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent. ESPN.com writer Len Pasquarelli has cited the rivalry as one of the best in sports: &apos;Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities. Unless you've attended a Falcons-Saints debauchery-filled afternoon, you'll just have to take my word for how much fun it really can be.&apos;<BR><BR>Atlanta currently leads the all-time series 49-45 (48-45 regular season, 1-0 playoffs). Each team has appeared in one Super Bowl, the Saints winning Super Bowl XLIV while the Falcons lost in Super Bowl XXXIII.<BR><BR>It began in 1967, the first year of play for the Saints, and press accounts from that game, including the Rome (Ga.)

Once the Nordiques moved to Denver, the small rivalry still existed. Also, in a regular season game between Detroit and Montreal, the Wings scored on Patrick Roy nine times, leading to Roy demanding a trade. Roy was eventually traded to Colorado and became a huge factor in the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry was largely predicated on the competitiveness of both teams in the late &apos;90s and early 2000s. From 1996–2002, the teams met in five playoff series, three times in the Western Conference Finals. Out of those seven seasons, the teams combined to win five Stanley Cups and four Presidents&apos; Trophies. From 1995–2003, both teams, along with the Devils, reigned exclusively as Stanley Cup champions, except in 1999, which was won by the Dallas Stars (the Devils beat the Red Wings in 1995, the Avalanche beat the Devils in 2001). The rivalry died down after the 2001–02 season, with the following season having both teams falling in round one and Roy&apos;s eventual retirement. The next confrontation between the two teams was in 2008, with the Red Wings sweeping the Avalanche 4–0 on the way to the Stanley Cup. A stadium series game took place on February 27, 2016 between the two teams at Coors Field. The Red Wings won the game 5–3.","number":"95"},{"team":"Les Canadiens de Montreal","teamLocation":"Les Canadiens de","teamName":"Montreal","teamAbb":"MTL

The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators&apos; first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators&apos; highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL&apos;s worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.<BR><BR>The Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators&apos; Eric Gryba laid out Montreal&apos;s Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators&apos; coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens&apos; coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a &apos;lack of respect.&apos; Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn&apos;t care what that &apos;bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.&apos; In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal&apos;s dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.<BR><BR>Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal&apos;s PK Subban slashed Ottawa&apos;s Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators&apos; coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa&apos;s Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa.","number":"102"},{"team":"Philadelphia Eagles","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Eagles","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"150.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Steelers","opponent":"steelers","opponentWins":"steelers28","league":"NFL","wins":"47","oWins":"28","ties":"3","oTies":"3","losses":"28","oLosses":"47","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1477","oFor":"1116","against":"1116","oAgainst":"1477","gamesPlayed":"78","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"1030.99","illY":"988.88","cBack":"#003B48","cOutline":"#C0C0C0","cText":"#708090","ocBack":"#000000","ocOutline":"#FFB612","ocText":"#FFB612","teamSmall":"eagles","bothTeamsBackwards":"steelers-eagles","bothTeams":"eagles-steelers","oldID":"eagles47","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly","class":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly philly eagles-steelers steelers philly nfl american football  pittsburgh-steelers pit pittsburgh steelers pa pennsylvania united-states  geographic  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "falcons16" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 7, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "bills7" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 11, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "bears11" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 3, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bengals3" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 17, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "browns17" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "cowboys49" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "broncos7" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 16, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "lions16" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 14, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "packers14" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 4, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans4" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "colts8" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars2" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 4, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "chiefs4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 19, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "rams19" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 10, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "vikings10" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 79, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "nyGiants79" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 10, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyJets10" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "raiders6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 47, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "steelers47" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "chargers4" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks7" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "buccaneers8" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "titans7" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 74, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "redskins74" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Colts", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bColts1" }, { "opponent": "Boston Yanks", "wins": 7, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "yanks7" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Tigers", "wins": 6, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "bTigers6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 3, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "reds3" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Texans", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans1" }, { "opponent": "New York Yanks", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyYanks2" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The two teams have met each other 78 times (including 1 postseason game), with the Philadelphia Eagles winning 47 games and the Pittsburgh Steelers winning 28 games.

The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the &apos;traditional&apos; Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.<BR><BR>The series was rarely noted by the national media during the teams' first decades of existence, probably due to both teams' long stretches of futility. However, the September 2006 match-up, which served as the Louisiana Superdome's official reopening after Hurricane Katrina, was heralded as a major milestone in New Orleans' and the Gulf Coast's recovery from the effects of the storm as well as the Saints' return to the city after their own year-long exile after the storm; the Saints later erected a statue outside the Superdome to commemorate their win in that game.<BR><BR>The late season match-ups in the 2010 and 2011 seasons held playoff implications for both teams. Games between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years; fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent. ESPN.com writer Len Pasquarelli has cited the rivalry as one of the best in sports: &apos;Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities.

The series name comes from the trophy the teams play for, which was first introduced in 1989 for an annual pre-season exhibition game between the two teams, and later reintroduced in 2008. The cup is awarded to the team that wins the most games against the other in a particular season. In the event of a tie, the team holding the trophy from the previous season retains it.<BR><BR>Prior to the introduction of interleague play, the Reds and Indians had only met in spring training or other exhibition games. Because the two teams play in opposite leagues, the only chance they can meet in the postseason is in the World Series. The Ohio Cup series was originally created in 1989 and was an exhibition game between the two teams played in the state capital of Columbus at Cooper Stadium just prior to the start of the season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, from 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six. The games in Columbus were typically well-attended, with attendance topping the stadium's 15,000-seat capacity in all but one year.<BR><BR>The regular-season series began in 1997 with the start of interleague play and has been played every season since except 2002. From 1999–2001 and every season since 2004, the teams meet in two three-game series per season, one in Cincinnati and one in Cleveland. For the 2013, 2014, and 2016 seasons, two two-game series were played back-to-back at each team's home field. Through the 2016 meetings, the Indians lead the all-time regular-season series 54–45.","number":"6"},{"team":"Buffalo Bills","teamLocation":"Buffalo","teamName":"Bills","teamAbb":"BUF","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"154.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Miami Dolphins","opponent":"dolphins","opponentWins":"dolphins58","league":"NFL","wins":"42","oWins":"58","ties":"1","oTies":"1","losses":"58","oLosses":"42","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1922","oFor":"2155","against":"2155","oAgainst":"1922","gamesPlayed":"101","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Buffalo, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"42.77","lng":"-78.79","illX":"1141.78","illY":"424.42","cBack":"#00338D","cOutline":"#C60C30","cText":"#C60C30","ocBack":"#008D97","ocOutline":"#F5811F","ocText":"#F5811F","teamSmall":"bills","bothTeamsBackwards":"dolphins-bills","bothTeams":"bills-dolphins","oldID":"bills42","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nfl american football  buffalo-bills buf buffalo bills ny new york united-states ","class":"nfl american football  buffalo-bills buf buffalo bills ny new york united-states  bills-dolphins dolphins  nfl american football  miami-dolphins mia miami dolphins fl florida united-states  divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "aCardinals7" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "falcons4" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 3, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "ravens3" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "cPanthers5" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "bears5" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 16, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "bengals16" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "browns8" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 4, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "cowboys4" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 19, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "broncos19" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 5, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "lions5" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 8, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "packers8" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 4, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "texans4" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 36, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "colts36" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "jaguars8" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 23, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "chiefs23" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "rams7" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 42, "losses": 58, "opponentWins": "dolphins42" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "vikings5" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 43, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "patriots43" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 4, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "saints4" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 6, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "nyGiants6" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 59, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "nyJets59" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 17, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "raiders17" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "eagles6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 8, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "steelers8" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 10, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "chargers10" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 6, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners6" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks5" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 3, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "buccaneers3" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 15, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "titans15" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 8, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "redskins8" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Bills–Dolphins rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins.

Owing to their geographical proximity, these two teams face each other every regular season in interleague play.","number":"10"},{"team":"Cleveland Browns","teamLocation":"Cleveland","teamName":"Browns","teamAbb":"CLE","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"162.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of Ohio","opponentTeam":"Cincinnati Bengals","opponent":"bengals","opponentWins":"bengals43","league":"NFL","wins":"39","oWins":"47","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"47","oLosses":"39","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1712","oFor":"1864","against":"1864","oAgainst":"1712","gamesPlayed":"86","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Cleveland, OH","stateAbb":"OH","state":"Ohio","country":"United States","lat":"41.51","lng":"-81.70","illX":"711.04","illY":"756.06","cBack":"#512F2D","cOutline":"#FE3C00","cText":"#FE3C00","ocBack":"#000000","ocOutline":"#FB4F14","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"browns","bothTeamsBackwards":"bengals-browns","bothTeams":"browns-bengals","oldID":"browns39","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nfl american football  cleveland-browns cle   oh ohio united-states ","class":"nfl american football  cleveland-browns cle   oh ohio united-states  browns-bengals bengals  nfl american football  cincinnati-bengals cin cincinnati bengals oh ohio united-states  geographic battle of ohio battle-of-ohio","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 33, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "aCardinals33" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 11, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "falcons11" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 9, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "ravens9" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 11, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "bills11" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 1, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "cPanthers1" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 9, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "bears9" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 39, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "bengals39" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 15, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "cowboys15" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 5, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "broncos5" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 4, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "lions4" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 7, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "packers7" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 3, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "texans3" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "colts14" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 5, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "jaguars5" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 11, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "chiefs11" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 9, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "rams9" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 8, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "dolphins8" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 4, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "vikings4" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "patriots12" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 13, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "saints13" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 26, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "nyGiants26" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "nyJets12" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 10, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "raiders10" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 31, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "eagles31" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 58, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "steelers58" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 8, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "chargers8" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 18, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners18" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 6, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "seahawks6" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "buccaneers6" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 35, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "titans35" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 33, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "redskins33" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Colts", "wins": 7, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bColts7" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Dodgers", "wins": 6, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bDodgers6" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 6, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bills6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Hornets", "wins": 8, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "cHornets8" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dons", "wins": 6, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "dons6" }, { "opponent": "Miami Seahawks", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "mSeahawks2" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 7, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "yankees7" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Bengals–Browns rivalry, dubbed The Battle of Ohio by fans, is a rivalry between the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL).

The colors of each team are similar, since the Browns recently updated their colors to choose the same shade of orange used the Bengals.<BR><BR>In 1989, Bengals coach Sam Wyche told Cincinnati fans during a game between the Bengals and Seattle Seahawks at Riverfront Stadium, &apos;You don't live in Cleveland, you live in Cincinnati!&apos; in response to debris being thrown from the stands.<BR><BR>The Bengals and Browns first played in 1970. Previously, the Bengals were a part of the American Football League. After the AFL–NFL merger the Bengals and Browns were placed in the AFC Central Division. They have played twice a year since 1970, except in 1982 due to Player's strike-shortened season and 1996–98 due to the Browns being inactive as a result of the Browns' relocation to Baltimore and a subsequent expansion franchise being awarded to Cleveland.

The two teams have combined for six Super Bowl victories (four by the Patriots) and eight AFC Championships since 2001, while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<BR><BR>The nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were AFC East division rivals from 1970–2001 (dating prior to the Colts' move from Baltimore to Indianapolis), their intensified enmity wasn't prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed AFC South following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment. Following New England's 43–22 win in the 2013–14 playoffs the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411–351.<BR><BR>The modern matchup spanning the period of 1998–2011 was usually headlined as a contest between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003–10; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter Drew Bledsoe, and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a 2004 AFC Divisional playoff game. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007–14. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie Andrew Luck.","number":"68"},{"team":"Minnesota Wild","teamLocation":"Minnesota","teamName":"Wild","teamAbb":"MIN","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"168.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks24","league":"NHL","wins":"37","oWins":"24","ties":"1","oTies":"1","losses":"22","oLosses":"28","otLosses":"2","oOtLosses":"9","for":"176","oFor":"158","against":"158","oAgainst":"176","gamesPlayed":"62","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"St Paul, MN","stateAbb":"MN","state":"Minnesota","country":"United States","lat":"44.94","lng":"-93.10","illX":"184.35","illY":"394.41","cBack":"#004F30","cOutline":"#EEE3C7","cText":"#C51230","ocBack":"#C60C30","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"wild","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-wild","bothTeams":"wild-blackhawks","oldID":"wild37","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-wild min minnesota wild mn minnesota united-states ","class":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-wild min minnesota wild mn minnesota united-states  wild-blackhawks blackhawks  nhl ice hockey  chicago-blackhawks chi chicago blackhawks il illinois united-states chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town manufactured  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 25, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "ducks25" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 14, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bruins14" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 11, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "sabres11" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "hurricanes10" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 25, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "blueJackets25" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 36, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames36" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 37, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "blackhawks37" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 45, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "avalanche45" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 24, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "dStars24" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 16, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "redWings16" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 48, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "oilers48" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 13, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "panthers13" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 27, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "laKings27" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "canadiens8" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "devils5" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 27, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "predators27" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 11, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "islanders11" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 7, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "nyRangers7" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 5, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 6, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "flyers6" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 28, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "coyotes28" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 12, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "penguins12" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 22, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "sharks22" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 27, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "blues27" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "lightning12" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 10, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs10" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 36, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "canucks36" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 15, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "wJets15" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "capitals9" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Blackhawks–Wild rivalry started during the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs when the two teams met in the first round.

The rivalry became even more intense with another playoff meeting between the Blackhawks and the Wild in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, this time in the second round. The Blackhawks would once again turn out victorious, this time winning in six games. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Blackhawks and the Wild met again in the second round. The Blackhawks would win yet again, but this time, in the fashion of a sweep. The rivalry has sparked interest within the NHL, and during the 2015 All Star Weekend in Columbus, the League announced two NHL Stadium Series games and the 2016 NHL Winter Classic.

The rivalry became even more intense with another playoff meeting between the Blackhawks and the Wild in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, this time in the second round. The Blackhawks would once again turn out victorious, this time winning in six games. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Blackhawks and the Wild met again in the second round. The Blackhawks would win yet again, but this time, in the fashion of a sweep. The rivalry has sparked interest within the NHL, and during the 2015 All Star Weekend in Columbus, the League announced two NHL Stadium Series games and the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. Game one of the 2016 NHL Stadium Series featured the Blackhawks and the Wild at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 21, 2016.

The Seahawks currently lead the all-time series record 21–15, including 1–0 in the playoffs.<br><br><br><br>The two teams were not rivals until 2002, when the Seahawks returned to the NFC for the first time since their inaugural 1976 season. Prior to 2002, the 49ers led the all-time series 4–2, but since they became NFC West divisional rivals in 2002, the Seahawks lead the series 19–11. The rivalry was once considered not very significant, due to the two teams having little history against each other and with both suffering significant stretches of mediocrity. For example, while the Seahawks won four straight division titles from 2004–2007, the 49ers finished in third or fourth place each season and did not have a winning season from 2003–2010. Likewise, the Seahawks suffered four straight losing seasons from 2008–2011. Despite their stretch of mediocrity, the Seahawks have remained competitive in games against the 49ers in those years, especially games at CenturyLink Field, where their worst loss to the 49ers there was by only ten points in 2006.<br><br>The rivalry intensified in 2011, when long-standing college rival coaches — former USC coach Pete Carroll and former Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh — took over as head coaches, with Carroll becoming the Seahawks&apos; coach in 2010, and Harbaugh becoming the 49ers coach the following season. Both teams drafted young, mobile quarterbacks to lead their franchises, Seattle&apos;s Russell Wilson and San Francisco&apos;s Colin Kaepernick. Both coaches turned their respective franchises into perennial playoff contenders, and from 2010 to 2014, either the Seahawks or the 49ers have claimed the NFC West championship.<br><br>Since Russell Wilson became the starter for Seattle in the 2012 season, the 49ers have been outscored 216-92 in the regular season.<br><br>The two teams met in the 2013 NFC Championship Game in CenturyLink Field with a trip to Super Bowl XLVIII on the line, with the Seahawks winning by a score of 23–17. The game ended when Seahawks&apos; cornerback Richard Sherman, whom Jim Harbaugh previously coached at Stanford, tipped an end zone pass that led to a game-ending interception. Seattle went on to defeat the Denver Broncos 43–8 in Super Bowl XLVIII to win their first Super Bowl championship. San Francisco had represented the NFC in a losing effort in Super Bowl XLVII the previous season.","number":"79"},{"team":"Baltimore Ravens","teamLocation":"Baltimore","teamName":"Ravens","teamAbb":"BAL","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"177.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Steelers","opponent":"steelers","opponentWins":"steelers24","league":"NFL","wins":"20","oWins":"21","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"21","oLosses":"20","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"787","oFor":"798","against":"798","oAgainst":"787","gamesPlayed":"41","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Baltimore, MD","stateAbb":"MD","state":"Maryland","country":"United States","lat":"39.28","lng":"-76.62","illX":"1426.09","illY":"1143.18","cBack":"#D0B240","cOutline":"#280353","cText":"#000000","ocBack":"#000000","ocOutline":"#FFB612","ocText":"#FFB612","teamSmall":"ravens","bothTeamsBackwards":"steelers-ravens","bothTeams":"ravens-steelers","oldID":"ravens20","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nfl american football  baltimore-ravens bal baltimore ravens md maryland united-states ","class":"nfl american football  baltimore-ravens bal baltimore ravens md maryland united-states  ravens-steelers steelers  nfl american football  pittsburgh-steelers pit pittsburgh steelers pa pennsylvania united-states  divisional  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 4, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "aCardinals4" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 3, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "falcons3" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 4, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "bills4" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers2" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "bears2" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 21, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "bengals21" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 27, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "browns27" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 4, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "cowboys4" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 5, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "broncos5" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 3, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "lions3" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 1, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "packers1" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 6, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "texans6" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 3, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "colts3" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 9, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "jaguars9" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 3, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "chiefs3" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 4, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "rams4" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 3, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "vikings3" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 1, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "patriots1" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "saints5" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 3, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "nyGiants3" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 8, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "nyJets8" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "raiders6" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 1, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "eagles1" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 20, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "steelers20" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "chargers6" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 3, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners3" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "seahawks2" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 3, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "buccaneers3" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 9, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "titans9" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 3, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "redskins3" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Ravens-Steelers rivalry is an American football rivalry between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led The Drive to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win 23–20 in overtime. The next year, both teams met again in the 1987 AFC Championship game at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns QB Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21. Interestingly, the Broncos would not go on to win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they beat the Browns.","number":"63"},{"team":"Pittsburgh Penguins","teamLocation":"Pittsburgh","teamName":"Penguins","teamAbb":"PIT","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"179.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Columbus Blue Jackets","opponent":"blueJackets","opponentWins":"blueJackets7","league":"NHL","wins":"17","oWins":"10","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"7","oLosses":"14","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"3","for":"88","oFor":"73","against":"73","oAgainst":"88","gamesPlayed":"27","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Pittsburgh, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"40.44","lng":"-79.99","illX":"970.31","illY":"937.58","cBack":"#C5B358","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#002147","ocOutline":"#C60C30","ocText":"#C9C9C9","teamSmall":"penguins","bothTeamsBackwards":"blueJackets-penguins","bothTeams":"penguins-blueJackets","oldID":"penguins17","extraClass":"pens pittsburgh-pens","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens","class":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens penguins-blueJackets blueJackets pens pittsburgh-pens nhl ice hockey  columbus-blue-jackets cbs columbus blue jackets oh ohio united-states jackets columbus-jackets jackets columbus-jackets blue-jackets bluejackets manufactured  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 19, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "ducks19" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 67, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "bruins67" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 83, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sabres83" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 67, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "hurricanes67" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 17, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "blueJackets17" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 44, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blackhawks44" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 35, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "barons35" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 67, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "dStars67" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 68, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "redWings68" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 63, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "laKings63" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wild8" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 62, "losses": 112, "opponentWins": "canadiens62" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 98, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "devils98" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 116, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "islanders116" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 120, "losses": 115, "opponentWins": "nyRangers120" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 97, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "flyers97" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 42, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "coyotes42" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 16, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks16" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 52, "losses": 66, "opponentWins": "blues52" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 83, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs83" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 63, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks63" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 43, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets43" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 105, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "capitals105" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Columbus Blue Jackets have established a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Penguins in recent history (as of the 2013–14 season). This is referenced in telecasts, news articles  and online arguments between fans of the clubs. This rivalry is one of the NHL&apos;s newest, and primarily exists due to divisional and geographical alignments (Columbus and Pittsburgh are approximately 3 hours apart by automobile, via Interstate 70). As a result, it is not uncommon to see large numbers of visiting Penguins fans at games versus the Jackets in Nationwide Arena. Pittsburgh holds a 16–7–0 all-time regular season record, a 4–2 all-time playoff record, and a series victory in the lone playoff series to date between the two teams.<BR><BR>The seeds for this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, the latter of whom has a personal feud with Penguins&apos; star centerman Sidney Crosby. The 2013–14 NHL realignment saw the Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against the Jackets, but Columbus, on the heels of a 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games.<BR><BR>Despite this series victory however, the Blue Jackets have gotten the better of the Penguins from that point on, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus over the past two years of play. Further intensifying the rivalry, the Jackets fired head coach Todd Richards early in the 2015–16 season, replacing him with John Tortorella, who has a long-standing disdain for the Penguins, dating back to his days as head coach of the New York Rangers.<BR><BR>Tensions between the teams further flared up during a regular season game at Nationwide Arena on November 27, 2015, when Brandon Dubinsky was penalized for a cross-check to Sidney Crosby, a hit which briefly injured Crosby and later earned Dubinsky a one-game suspension. Crosby would later return to the game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2-1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky&apos;s suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: &apos;We&apos;re not going to whine here. Pittsburgh can whine. Pittsburgh whines enough for the whole league, so there&apos;s no room for any other team to whine.

Prior to 2002, the 49ers led the all-time series 4–2, but since they became NFC West divisional rivals in 2002, the Seahawks lead the series 19–11. The rivalry was once considered not very significant, due to the two teams having little history against each other and with both suffering significant stretches of mediocrity. For example, while the Seahawks won four straight division titles from 2004–2007, the 49ers finished in third or fourth place each season and did not have a winning season from 2003–2010. Likewise, the Seahawks suffered four straight losing seasons from 2008–2011.

Both teams drafted young, mobile quarterbacks to lead their franchises, Seattle&apos;s Russell Wilson and San Francisco&apos;s Colin Kaepernick.

The rivalry reached its peak from 2001 to 2005, during which time the Earthquakes and the Galaxy combined to win four MLS Cup titles in a five-year period. The term &apos;Clásico&apos; is commonly used to refer to other rivalries in Spanish-speaking countries, most prominently, the Spanish Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, or the Argentine Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate. Los Angeles and San Jose is considered to be one of the most historical rivalries in American soccer. British daily newspaper, The Guardian rates &apos;the California Clásico is perhaps the most historical and intense rivalry the league has.&apos; Todd Dunivant, retired U.S. national team and MLS player, when asked about the rivalry stated &apos;I think it's the best rivalry in MLS, I think it's got the most history, it's got the most meaningful big games&apos;. The rivalry originated from the historical Northern California vs. Southern California sporting and cultural rivalries, as well as from the relative proximity of the cities, which are about 360 miles (580 km) apart, which allows rival fans to attend each other's games. They are sometimes identified with opposing political positions, with Los Angeles (Southern California) viewed as representing conservatism and San Jose (Northern California) viewed as representing liberalism.

For United, the Red Bulls are the only opponent they have competed against in more than five occasions in both the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and the MLS Cup Playoffs.<BR><BR>Traditionally, the rivalry has been in favor of D.C. United, in terms of silverware collected and matches won.

In addition to annual preseason matchups, the only other way the two teams would meet would be in the Super Bowl.","number":"71"},{"team":"Columbus Blue Jackets","teamLocation":"Columbus","teamName":"Blue Jackets","teamAbb":"CBS","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"196.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Penguins","opponent":"penguins","opponentWins":"penguins17","league":"NHL","wins":"10","oWins":"17","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"14","oLosses":"7","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"3","for":"73","oFor":"88","against":"88","oAgainst":"73","gamesPlayed":"27","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Columbus, OH","stateAbb":"OH","state":"Ohio","country":"United States","lat":"39.97","lng":"-83.01","illX":"784.03","illY":"959.96","cBack":"#002147","cOutline":"#C60C30","cText":"#C9C9C9","ocBack":"#C5B358","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"blueJackets","bothTeamsBackwards":"penguins-blueJackets","bothTeams":"blueJackets-penguins","oldID":"blueJackets10","extraClass":"jackets columbus-jackets blue-jackets bluejackets","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  columbus-blue-jackets cbs columbus blue jackets oh ohio united-states jackets columbus-jackets jackets columbus-jackets blue-jackets bluejackets","class":"nhl ice hockey  columbus-blue-jackets cbs columbus blue jackets oh ohio united-states jackets columbus-jackets jackets columbus-jackets blue-jackets bluejackets blueJackets-penguins penguins jackets columbus-jackets blue-jackets bluejackets nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit pittsburgh penguins pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens pens pittsburgh-pens manufactured  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 28, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "ducks28" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 8, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bruins8" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 13, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "sabres13" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 12, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "hurricanes12" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 29, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "flames29" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 32, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "blackhawks32" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 17, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "avalanche17" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 22, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "dStars22" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 28, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "redWings28" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 19, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "oilers19" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 14, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "panthers14" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 22, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "laKings22" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 26, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "wild26" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 10, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "canadiens10" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "devils12" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 25, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "predators25" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 14, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "islanders14" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 10, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "nyRangers10" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 7, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "senators7" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 12, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "flyers12" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 23, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "coyotes23" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 10, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "penguins10" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 20, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "sharks20" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 30, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "blues30" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 9, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "lightning9" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 9, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs9" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 18, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "canucks18" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 10, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "wJets10" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 11, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "capitals11" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Columbus Blue Jackets have established a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Penguins in recent history (as of the 2013–14 season). This is referenced in telecasts, news articles  and online arguments between fans of the clubs. This rivalry is one of the NHL&apos;s newest, and primarily exists due to divisional and geographical alignments (Columbus and Pittsburgh are approximately 3 hours apart by automobile, via Interstate 70). As a result, it is not uncommon to see large numbers of visiting Penguins fans at games versus the Jackets in Nationwide Arena. Pittsburgh holds a 16–7–0 all-time regular season record, a 4–2 all-time playoff record, and a series victory in the lone playoff series to date between the two teams.<BR><BR>The seeds for this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, the latter of whom has a personal feud with Penguins&apos; star centerman Sidney Crosby. The 2013–14 NHL realignment saw the Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against the Jackets, but Columbus, on the heels of a 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games.<BR><BR>Despite this series victory however, the Blue Jackets have gotten the better of the Penguins from that point on, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus over the past two years of play. Further intensifying the rivalry, the Jackets fired head coach Todd Richards early in the 2015–16 season, replacing him with John Tortorella, who has a long-standing disdain for the Penguins, dating back to his days as head coach of the New York Rangers.<BR><BR>Tensions between the teams further flared up during a regular season game at Nationwide Arena on November 27, 2015, when Brandon Dubinsky was penalized for a cross-check to Sidney Crosby, a hit which briefly injured Crosby and later earned Dubinsky a one-game suspension. Crosby would later return to the game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2-1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky&apos;s suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: &apos;We&apos;re not going to whine here. Pittsburgh can whine. Pittsburgh whines enough for the whole league, so there&apos;s no room for any other team to whine.

The term &apos;Clásico&apos; is commonly used to refer to other rivalries in Spanish-speaking countries, most prominently, the Spanish Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, or the Argentine Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate. Los Angeles and San Jose is considered to be one of the most historical rivalries in American soccer. British daily newspaper, The Guardian rates &apos;the California Clásico is perhaps the most historical and intense rivalry the league has.&apos; Todd Dunivant, retired U.S. national team and MLS player, when asked about the rivalry stated &apos;I think it's the best rivalry in MLS, I think it's got the most history, it's got the most meaningful big games&apos;. The rivalry originated from the historical Northern California vs. Southern California sporting and cultural rivalries, as well as from the relative proximity of the cities, which are about 360 miles (580 km) apart, which allows rival fans to attend each other's games. They are sometimes identified with opposing political positions, with Los Angeles (Southern California) viewed as representing conservatism and San Jose (Northern California) viewed as representing liberalism.

In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led The Drive to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win 23–20 in overtime. The next year, both teams met again in the 1987 AFC Championship game at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns QB Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21. Interestingly, the Broncos would not go on to win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they beat the Browns.","number":"63"},{"team":"Seattle Sounders FC","teamLocation":"Seattle","teamName":"Sounders FC","teamAbb":"SEA","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"211.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Cascadia Cup","opponentTeam":"Portland Timbers","opponent":"timbers","opponentWins":"timbers3","league":"MLS","wins":"4","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"","losses":"-","oLosses":"","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"mls","sport":"Soccer","colour":"#993366","city":"Seattle, WA","stateAbb":"WA","state":"Washington","country":"United States","lat":"47.60","lng":"-122.33","illX":"78.66","illY":"316.54","cBack":"#005695","cOutline":"#5D9732","cText":"#132530","ocBack":"#004812","ocOutline":"#EAE727","ocText":"#EAE727","teamSmall":"sounders","bothTeamsBackwards":"timbers-sounders","bothTeams":"sounders-timbers","oldID":"sounders4","extraClass":"sounders fc","oldClass":"mls soccer  seattle-sounders-fc sea seattle sounders fc wa washington united-states sounders fc sounders fc","class":"mls soccer  seattle-sounders-fc sea seattle sounders fc wa washington united-states sounders fc sounders fc sounders-timbers timbers sounders fc mls soccer  portland-timbers ptl por portland timbers or oregon united-states  geographic cascadia cup cascadia-cup","info":[{"opponent": "Live Data Unavailable", "wins": "", "losses": "", "opponentWins": ""}],"rivalryNotes":"The Cascadia Cup is the name of the trophy created in 2004 by supporters of the Portland Timbers, Seattle Sounders, and Vancouver Whitecaps, which is awarded each season to the best soccer team in the Pacific Northwest.

The series is named after the late Lamar Hunt, who was one of the league's early major investors and a key supporter of American soccer. Initially, the series was contested between the two teams still owned by the Hunt Sports Group (Sporting Kansas City was also previously owned by the Hunt Sports Group, but was sold before the Pioneer Cup began). However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group. The Pioneer Cup is the second event in American soccer named after Lamar Hunt, whose name is also given to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.<BR><BR>The first two editions of the Pioneer Cup were single preseason matches. The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season. The first leg was played at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, OH on April 1, 2011. The Crew took advantage of FC Dallas going one man down in the 33rd minute to win 2–0. The second and deciding leg was played at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, TX on July 2, 2011, with Dallas winning 2–0. Tied 2–2 on aggregate, Columbus regained the Pioneer Cup with the tie being broken by all-time head to head goals, 6-4 in favor of Columbus.<BR><BR>When Major League Soccer restructured scheduling ahead of the 2012 season, Columbus and Dallas would play only once in the regular season. Therefore, the Cup was changed to a one-game, winner-take-all contest. In the event of a draw, the all time head-to-head goals tiebreaker remained. In the 2013 edition, Columbus scored four goals with three different scorers to win the Cup for the second straight year. The 2014 contest was a bit more lackluster than previous encounters. An early summer thunderstorm suspended the start of the match and then eventually postponed it to the following day after a Columbus fan was struck by lightning and injured prior to the game being started. The game was played the next day on a hot afternoon, but no player from either side could find the net in a match then ended scoreless. Due to the scoreless draw, Columbus retained the Cup for the third year in a row due to the all-time head-to-head goals tiebreaker being 12-7 in Columbus' favor.","number":"29"},{"team":"Chivas USA","teamLocation":"Chivas","teamName":"USA","teamAbb":"LA CUSA USA CU","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"218.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"SuperClasico","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Galaxy","opponent":"galaxy","opponentWins":"galaxy22","league":"MLS","wins":"4","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"","losses":"-","oLosses":"","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"mls","sport":"Soccer","colour":"#993366","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"33.86","lng":"-118.26","illX":"113.33","illY":"1198.00","cBack":"#ff0000","cOutline":"#ffffff","cText":"#000080","ocBack":"#00245D","ocOutline":"#3365B1","ocText":"#FFD900","teamSmall":"chivas","bothTeamsBackwards":"galaxy-chivas","bothTeams":"chivas-galaxy","oldID":"chivas4","extraClass":"","oldClass":"mls soccer  chivas-usa la cusa usa cu chivas usa ca california united-states ","class":"mls soccer  chivas-usa la cusa usa cu chivas usa ca california united-states  chivas-galaxy galaxy  mls soccer  los-angeles-galaxy la lag los angeles galaxy ca california united-states la la-galaxy la la-galaxy geographic superclasico superclasico","info":[{"opponent": "Live Data Unavailable", "wins": "", "losses": "", "opponentWins": ""}],"rivalryNotes":"The SuperClasico, formerly known as the Honda SuperClasico for sponsorship reasons, and also known as the L.A. Derby or El Clásico Angelino, was a sports rivalry between Major League Soccer teams LA Galaxy and Chivas USA. The rivalry was considered as the only &apos;true&apos; local derby in MLS from 2005 until 2014, as both teams were based in the StubHub Center in the Greater Los Angeles city of Carson, California. The rivalry ended in 2014 when Chivas ceased operations.<BR><BR>The word &apos;SuperClasico&apos; is an allegory to the Mexican Súper Clásico between Club América and Chivas USA's parent club Chivas Guadalajara. The term &apos;Clásico&apos; is commonly used to refer to other rivalries in Spanish-speaking countries, most prominently, Argentina's Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate or Spain's El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The derby was sponsored by auto company Honda.<BR><BR>From 2005–2007, the derby was four league matches (with a Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match in 2005). In 2008–2009, the derby was played three times (plus a two-legged playoff series in 2009). For 2010-2011, the derby was played twice each season. All games were played at StubHub Center, the local venue for both teams. However, in 2012, the league reverted to a more American-style format that sacrificed equity for divisional rivalries which resulted in the teams facing each other 3 times again. The Galaxy led Chivas in the derby, winning eight of nine cups all time.","number":"35"},{"team":"Portland Timbers","teamLocation":"Portland","teamName":"Timbers","teamAbb":"PTL POR","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"219.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Cascadia Cup","opponentTeam":"Seattle Sounders FC","opponent":"sounders","opponentWins":"sounders4","league":"MLS","wins":"3","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"","losses":"-","oLosses":"","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"mls","sport":"Soccer","colour":"#993366","city":"Portland, OR","stateAbb":"OR","state":"Oregon","country":"United States","lat":"45.52","lng":"-122.69","illX":"156.34","illY":"481.36","cBack":"#004812","cOutline":"#EAE727","cText":"#EAE727","ocBack":"#005695","ocOutline":"#5D9732","ocText":"#132530","teamSmall":"timbers","bothTeamsBackwards":"sounders-timbers","bothTeams":"timbers-sounders","oldID":"timbers3","extraClass":"","oldClass":"mls soccer  portland-timbers ptl por portland timbers or oregon united-states ","class":"mls soccer  portland-timbers ptl por portland timbers or oregon united-states  timbers-sounders sounders  mls soccer  seattle-sounders-fc sea seattle sounders fc wa washington united-states sounders fc sounders fc geographic cascadia cup cascadia-cup","info":[{"opponent": "Live Data Unavailable", "wins": "", "losses": "", "opponentWins": ""}],"rivalryNotes":"The Cascadia Cup is the name of the trophy created in 2004 by supporters of the Portland Timbers, Seattle Sounders, and Vancouver Whitecaps, which is awarded each season to the best soccer team in the Pacific Northwest.

The series is named after the late Lamar Hunt, who was one of the league's early major investors and a key supporter of American soccer.

However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group. The Pioneer Cup is the second event in American soccer named after Lamar Hunt, whose name is also given to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.<BR><BR>The first two editions of the Pioneer Cup were single preseason matches. The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season.

This has not held in the modern era of the meetings.","number":"65"},{"team":"New York City FC","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"City FC","teamAbb":"NYC NYFC NYCFC","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"226.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Hudson River Derby","opponentTeam":"New York Red Bulls","opponent":"redBulls","opponentWins":"redBulls5","league":"MLS","wins":"1","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"","losses":"-","oLosses":"","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"mls","sport":"Soccer","colour":"#993366","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.83","lng":"-73.93","illX":"1225.02","illY":"888.27","cBack":"#69ACE5","cOutline":"#FF5400","cText":"#0F1D41","ocBack":"#23326A","ocOutline":"#ED1E36","ocText":"#FABB23","teamSmall":"cityFC","bothTeamsBackwards":"redBulls-cityFC","bothTeams":"cityFC-redBulls","oldID":"cityFC1","extraClass":"ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc","oldClass":"mls soccer  new-york-city-fc nyc nyfc nycfc new york city fc ny new york united-states ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc","class":"mls soccer  new-york-city-fc nyc nyfc nycfc new york city fc ny new york united-states ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc cityFC-redBulls redBulls ny-fc new-york-fc ny fc mls soccer  new-york-red-bulls ny nyc nyrb new york red bulls ny new york united-states ny-red-bulls ny-bulls new-york-bulls red-bull bulls bull ny-red-bulls ny-bulls new-york-bulls red-bull bulls bull geographic hudson river derby hudson-river-derby","info":[{"opponent": "Live Data Unavailable", "wins": "", "losses": "", "opponentWins": ""}],"rivalryNotes":"The Hudson River Derby, also known as the New York derby, is the name given the soccer local derby between the two Major League Soccer (MLS) teams based in the New York metropolitan area, New York Red Bulls and New York City FC.

There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), the tables were turned, thanks to an 18-year-old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding three games to one series lead, and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes.","number":"101"},{"team":"Winnipeg Jets","teamLocation":"Winnipeg","teamName":"Jets","teamAbb":"WIN WPG","teamNotes":"Original Franchise, now Arizona Coyotes","fixed":"TRUE","index":"228.00","rivalryType":"expansion","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Calgary Flames","opponent":"flames","opponentWins":"flames0","league":"NHL","wins":"79","oWins":"12","ties":"20","oTies":"1","losses":"86","oLosses":"9","otLosses":"4","oOtLosses":"0","for":"613","oFor":"70","against":"670","oAgainst":"59","gamesPlayed":"189","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Winnipeg, MB","stateAbb":"MB","state":"Manitoba","country":"Canada","lat":"49.89","lng":"-97.20","illX":"390.93","illY":"63.82","cBack":"#002D62","cOutline":"#006EC8","cText":"#C9C9C9","ocBack":"#CB0D0D","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FDBF12","teamSmall":"wJets","bothTeamsBackwards":"flames-wJets","bothTeams":"wJets-flames","oldID":"wJets79","extraClass":"arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  winnipeg-jets win wpg   mb manitoba canada arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes","class":"nhl ice hockey  winnipeg-jets win wpg   mb manitoba canada arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes wJets-flames flames arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes nhl ice hockey  calgary-flames cgy calgary flames ab alberta canada atlanta atlanta-flames atlanta atlanta-flames expansion  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 48, "losses": 58, "opponentWins": "ducks48" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 21, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "bruins21" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 23, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "sabres23" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 29, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "hurricanes29" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 28, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "blueJackets28" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 79, "losses": 86, "opponentWins": "flames79" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 56, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "blackhawks56" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 52, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "avalanche52" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 71, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "dStars71" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 47, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "redWings47" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 80, "losses": 92, "opponentWins": "oilers80" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "panthers16" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 107, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "laKings107" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 25, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "wild25" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 16, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "canadiens16" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 38, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "devils38" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 30, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "predators30" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 26, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "islanders26" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 25, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "nyRangers25" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 15, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "senators15" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 30, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "flyers30" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 29, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "penguins29" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 60, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "sharks60" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 56, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blues56" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 15, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "lightning15" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 51, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs51" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 71, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "canucks71" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 15, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets15" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 29, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "capitals29" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Flames and Jets (the original incarnation) met in the playoffs three straight years in the 1980s, with Winnipeg winning two of the three matchups.

There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), the tables were turned, thanks to an 18-year-old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding three games to one series lead, and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes.","number":"101"},{"team":"New York Rangers","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Rangers","teamAbb":"NYR","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"233.00","rivalryType":"territorial","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New York Americans","opponent":"americans","opponentWins":"americans0","league":"NHL","wins":"57","oWins":"23","ties":"14","oTies":"14","losses":"23","oLosses":"57","otLosses":"0","oOtLosses":"0","for":"295","oFor":"189","against":"189","oAgainst":"295","gamesPlayed":"94","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.75","lng":"-73.99","illX":"1145.15","illY":"822.08","cBack":"#0161AB","cOutline":"#E51837","cText":"#FFFFFF","ocBack":"#e03a3e","ocOutline":"#005fa9","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"nyRangers","bothTeamsBackwards":"americans-nyRangers","bothTeams":"nyRangers-americans","oldID":"nyRangers57","extraClass":"ny-rangers ny","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny ny-rangers ny","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny ny-rangers ny nyRangers-americans americans ny-rangers ny nhl ice hockey  new-york-americans nya nyc ny new york americans ny new york united-states ny-americans ny ny-americans ny territorial  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 14, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "ducks14" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 254, "losses": 289, "opponentWins": "bruins254" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 70, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "sabres70" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 75, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "hurricanes75" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 14, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets14" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 240, "losses": 245, "opponentWins": "blackhawks240" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 217, "losses": 262, "opponentWins": "redWings217" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 67, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "laKings67" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 194, "losses": 328, "opponentWins": "canadiens194" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 28, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "maroons28" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 111, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "devils111" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Americans", "wins": 57, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "americans57" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "islanders125" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 17, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "senators17" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 39, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "senators39" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 128, "losses": 113, "opponentWins": "flyers128" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 6, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "quakers6" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 44, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "coyotes44" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "penguins125" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 18, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "pirates18" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 24, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "sharks24" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "stlEagles5" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 79, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "blues79" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 46, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "lightning46" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 228, "losses": 275, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs228" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 78, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "canucks78" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 28, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "wJets28" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 95, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "capitals95" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The New York Americans and New York Rangers had a rivalry that existed between 1925 and 1942. The two teams played in Madison Square Garden however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born. The two teams first met in the playoffs via two-game total goals series in 1929. Both teams struggled to score in both games as goaltender Roy Worters of the Americans shut down the Rangers for the most part, and the Americans struggled to find offense during the games. The Rangers would win the series 1–0 in overtime.<BR><BR>The Americans then struggled to make the playoffs only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once America joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994, seven years after Dutton died in 1987.","number":"111"},{"team":"Minnesota North Stars","teamLocation":"Minnesota","teamName":"North Stars","teamAbb":"MIN","teamNotes":"Defunct, now Dallas Stars","fixed":"TRUE","index":"234.00","rivalryType":"historical","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks0","league":"NHL","wins":"0","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"-","oLosses":"-","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Bloomington, MN","stateAbb":"MN","state":"Minnesota","country":"United States","lat":"44.86","lng":"-93.24","illX":"222.78","illY":"288.01","cBack":"#008348","cOutline":"#fdb827","cText":"#000000","ocBack":"#C60C30","ocOutline":"#000000","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"northStars","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-northStars","bothTeams":"blackhawks-dStars","oldID":"northStars0","extraClass":"stars dallas dallas-stars","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-north-stars min minnesota north stars mn minnesota united-states stars dallas dallas-stars stars dallas dallas-stars","class":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-north-stars min minnesota north stars mn minnesota united-states stars dallas dallas-stars stars dallas dallas-stars northStars-blackhawks blackhawks stars dallas dallas-stars nhl ice hockey  chicago-blackhawks chi chicago blackhawks il illinois united-states chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town chicago-black-hawks black-hawks hawks chicago-hawks chi-town historical  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 69, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "ducks69" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 33, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "bruins33" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 46, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "sabres46" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 42, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "hurricanes42" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 33, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "blueJackets33" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 67, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "flames67" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 105, "losses": 126, "opponentWins": "blackhawks105" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 29, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "barons29" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 55, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "avalanche55" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 104, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "redWings104" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 69, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "oilers69" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 14, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "panthers14" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 110, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "laKings110" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 38, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "wild38" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 34, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "canadiens34" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 53, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "devils53" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 42, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "predators42" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 39, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "islanders39" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 41, "losses": 72, "opponentWins": "nyRangers41" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 21, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators21" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 42, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "flyers42" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 86, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "coyotes86" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 62, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "penguins62" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 62, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "sharks62" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 107, "losses": 120, "opponentWins": "blues107" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 22, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "lightning22" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 90, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs90" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 91, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "canucks91" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 20, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "wJets20" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 48, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "capitals48" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The North Stars and the Blackhawks played each other in the playoffs six times from 1982 through 1991. The rivalry was at its most fierce from 1982 through 1985, when the teams played in four straight playoff series, with the Blackhawks winning three out of the four. In 1991, the Blackhawks had won the President&apos;s Trophy with 106 points and were one of the favorites to win the Stanley Cup. But, despite finishing with 68 points (38 behind the Blackhawks) during the season, Minnesota upset the first place overall Blackhawks in six games beginning their Cinderella run to the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals where they lost in six games to the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was the second largest upset in NHL history in points. Chicago would get a small measure of revenge the following year, when they dethroned Minnesota as Campbell Conference Champions. But just like the North Stars the year before, the Blackhawks would lose to the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final. The rivalry died in 1993, when the North Stars moved to Dallas.","number":"94"},{"team":"Quebec Nordiques","teamLocation":"Quebec","teamName":"Nordiques","teamAbb":"QUE QC","teamNotes":"Defunct, now Colorado Avalanche","fixed":"TRUE","index":"235.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of Quebec","opponentTeam":"Montreal Canadiens","opponent":"canadiens","opponentWins":"canadiens0","league":"NHL","wins":"0","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"-","oLosses":"-","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Quebec City, QC","stateAbb":"QC","state":"Quebec","country":"Canada","lat":"46.83","lng":"-71.25","illX":"1360.79","illY":"73.58","cBack":"#3d4dac","cOutline":"#e82f2c","cText":"#eeeeee","ocBack":"#083A81","ocOutline":"#FFFFFF","ocText":"#C51230","teamSmall":"nordiques","bothTeamsBackwards":"canadiens-nordiques","bothTeams":"canadiens-avalanche","oldID":"nordiques0","extraClass":"colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  quebec-nordiques que qc quebec nordiques qc quebec canada colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche","class":"nhl ice hockey  quebec-nordiques que qc quebec nordiques qc quebec canada colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche nordiques-canadiens canadiens colorado-avalanche colorado avalanche nhl ice hockey  les-canadiens-de-montreal mtl mon les canadiens de montreal qc quebec canada canadians montreal-canadians les-canadiens-de-montreal les-canadiens-montreal les-canadiens canadians montreal-canadians les-canadiens-de-montreal les-canadiens-montreal les-canadiens geographic battle of quebec battle-of-quebec","info":[ { "opponent": "Michigan Stags/Baltimore Blades", "wins": 11, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "blades11" }, { "opponent": "Birmingham Bulls", "wins": 44, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "bBulls44" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Cowboys", "wins": 20, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "cCowboys20" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cougars", "wins": 11, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "cougars11" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Stingers", "wins": 18, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "stingers18" }, { "opponent": "Czechoslovakia", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "czechoslovakia2" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 38, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "oilers38" }, { "opponent": "Houston Aeros", "wins": 22, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "aeros22" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Racers", "wins": 21, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "racers21" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Fighting Saints", "wins": 8, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "fightingSaints8" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Fighting Saints", "wins": 13, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "fightingSaints13" }, { "opponent": "New England Whalers", "wins": 34, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "whalers34" }, { "opponent": "Denver Spurs/Ottawa Civics", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "civics1" }, { "opponent": "Phoenix Roadrunners", "wins": 11, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "roadrunners11" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Mariners", "wins": 15, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "sdMariners15" }, { "opponent": "Soviet All-Stars", "wins": 0, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "allStars0" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 26, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "wJets26" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Battle of Quebec is the nickname for a former NHL rivalry between the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques.

The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in 1926 for a 2-game total-goals series. The final game had 11,000 fans packed in an arena meant for 10,000 as the Canadiens defeated the Maroons. The next year the Maroons would have their revenge as they defeated the Canadiens 3–2 in total goals. This would be their last playoff meeting before the Maroons eventually folded in 1938.","number":"107"},{"team":"Boston Bruins","teamLocation":"Boston","teamName":"Bruins","teamAbb":"BOS","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"240.00","rivalryType":"territorial","rivalryName":"Battle of New England","opponentTeam":"New England Whalers","opponent":"whalers","opponentWins":"whalers0","league":"NHL","wins":"0","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"-","oLosses":"-","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Boston, MA","stateAbb":"MA","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","lat":"42.37","lng":"-71.06","illX":"1061.06","illY":"580.89","cBack":"#000000","cOutline":"#FDB930","cText":"#FDB930","ocBack":"#00205b","ocOutline":"#007b21","ocText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"bruins","bothTeamsBackwards":"whalers-bruins","bothTeams":"bruins-hartford","oldID":"bruins0","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  boston-bruins bos   ma massachusetts united-states ","class":"nhl ice hockey  boston-bruins bos   ma massachusetts united-states  bruins-whalers whalers  nhl ice hockey  hartford-whalers har hartford whalers ct connecticut united-states  territorial battle of new england battle-of-new-england","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 13, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "ducks13" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 133, "losses": 110, "opponentWins": "sabres133" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 104, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "hurricanes104" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 15, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "blueJackets15" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 57, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "flames57" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 264, "losses": 237, "opponentWins": "blackhawks264" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 44, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "barons44" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 72, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "avalanche72" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 77, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "dStars77" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 244, "losses": 251, "opponentWins": "redWings244" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 45, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "oilers45" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 48, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "panthers48" }, { "opponent": "Hamilton Tigers", "wins": 1, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "hTigers1" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 82, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "laKings82" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 6, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "wild6" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 273, "losses": 351, "opponentWins": "canadiens273" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 40, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "maroons40" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 81, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "devils81" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "predators12" }, { "opponent": "New York Americans", "wins": 57, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "americans57" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 83, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "islanders83" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 291, "losses": 245, "opponentWins": "nyRangers291" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 21, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "senators21" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 74, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "senators74" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 101, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "flyers101" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 5, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "quakers5" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 46, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "coyotes46" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 110, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "penguins110" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 18, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "pirates18" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 17, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "sharks17" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "stlEagles5" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 63, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "blues63" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 58, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "lightning58" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 295, "losses": 259, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs295" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 70, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "canucks70" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 35, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "wJets35" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 76, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "capitals76" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry was first started before the two teams ever met on the ice when the Bruins &apos;blocked&apos;

It got to a point where Samuelsson hit Neely in the knees during the 1991 Stanley Cup playoffs, but Samuelsson was traded to the Penguins earlier that season. At the Hartford Civic Center, usually where the Bruins won, the Whalers fans would fight Bruins fans on Ann St. in Downtown Hartford.

But, despite finishing with 68 points (38 behind the Blackhawks) during the season, Minnesota upset the first place overall Blackhawks in six games beginning their Cinderella run to the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals where they lost in six games to the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was the second largest upset in NHL history in points. Chicago would get a small measure of revenge the following year, when they dethroned Minnesota as Campbell Conference Champions. But just like the North Stars the year before, the Blackhawks would lose to the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final. The rivalry died in 1993, when the North Stars moved to Dallas.","number":"94"},{"team":"New York Americans","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Americans","teamAbb":"NYA NYC NY","teamNotes":"Defunct","fixed":"TRUE","index":"242.00","rivalryType":"territorial","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New York Rangers","opponent":"nyRangers","opponentWins":"nyRangers0","league":"NHL","wins":"23","oWins":"57","ties":"14","oTies":"14","losses":"57","oLosses":"23","otLosses":"0","oOtLosses":"0","for":"189","oFor":"295","against":"295","oAgainst":"189","gamesPlayed":"94","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.75","lng":"-73.99","illX":"1239.90","illY":"739.59","cBack":"#e03a3e","cOutline":"#005fa9","cText":"#ffffff","ocBack":"#0161AB","ocOutline":"#E51837","ocText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"americans","bothTeamsBackwards":"nyRangers-americans","bothTeams":"americans-nyRangers","oldID":"americans23","extraClass":"ny-americans ny","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-americans nya nyc ny new york americans ny new york united-states ny-americans ny ny-americans ny","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-americans nya nyc ny new york americans ny new york united-states ny-americans ny ny-americans ny americans-nyRangers nyRangers ny-americans ny nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr new york rangers ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny ny-rangers ny territorial  ","info":[ { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 32, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "bruins32" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 36, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "blackhawks36" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 26, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "redWings26" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 39, "losses": 63, "opponentWins": "canadiens39" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 32, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "maroons32" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 23, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "nyRangers23" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 19, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "senators19" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 3, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "quakers3" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 13, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "pirates13" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 0, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "stlEagles0" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 32, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs32" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The New York Americans and New York Rangers had a rivalry that existed between 1925 and 1942. The two teams played in Madison Square Garden however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born. The two teams first met in the playoffs via two-game total goals series in 1929. Both teams struggled to score in both games as goaltender Roy Worters of the Americans shut down the Rangers for the most part, and the Americans struggled to find offense during the games. The Rangers would win the series 1–0 in overtime.<BR><BR>The Americans then struggled to make the playoffs only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once America joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994, seven years after Dutton died in 1987.","number":"111"}], "labels": [{"team":"San Francisco Giants","teamLocation":"San Francisco","teamName":"Giants","teamAbb":"SF","teamNotes":"f.

After a lengthy review process, the umpires determined that Odor should be allowed to score, infuriating the Toronto crowd; Choo would strike out on the next pitch to end the inning.

However, on the same play, he was able to recover in time to throw to second base for the second out, bringing up slugging Jays outfielder Jose Bautista with runners on the corners and two outs. On a 1-1 count, Bautista smoked a line drive home run to left field to put Toronto ahead 6-3, and did a dramatic bat flip to celebrate.

The series is named after the late Lamar Hunt, who was one of the league's early major investors and a key supporter of American soccer. Initially, the series was contested between the two teams still owned by the Hunt Sports Group (Sporting Kansas City was also previously owned by the Hunt Sports Group, but was sold before the Pioneer Cup began). However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group. The Pioneer Cup is the second event in American soccer named after Lamar Hunt, whose name is also given to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.<BR><BR>The first two editions of the Pioneer Cup were single preseason matches. The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season. The first leg was played at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, OH on April 1, 2011. The Crew took advantage of FC Dallas going one man down in the 33rd minute to win 2–0. The second and deciding leg was played at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, TX on July 2, 2011, with Dallas winning 2–0. Tied 2–2 on aggregate, Columbus regained the Pioneer Cup with the tie being broken by all-time head to head goals, 6-4 in favor of Columbus.<BR><BR>When Major League Soccer restructured scheduling ahead of the 2012 season, Columbus and Dallas would play only once in the regular season. Therefore, the Cup was changed to a one-game, winner-take-all contest. In the event of a draw, the all time head-to-head goals tiebreaker remained. In the 2013 edition, Columbus scored four goals with three different scorers to win the Cup for the second straight year. The 2014 contest was a bit more lackluster than previous encounters.

In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky's 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's full count of 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught \"that an assist was good as a goal.\"\n\nThe two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981–82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists).

The Kings, after a fairly impressive 1980–81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL.

During this time, the Oilers and Flames won each Stanley Cup between 1984 and 1990, with the exception of 1986, when the Flames lost to the Montreal Canadiens.

The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in 1989, led by superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour and Mike Vernon. This was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they face each other in the first or second round rather than in the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that the other two playoff qualifiers from the Smythe would have to get past either the Oilers or Flames – or both – to make the conference finals.

The Flames were favored in the 1988 playoffs, having won the Presidents' Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup. 1991 was the last year the teams met in the playoffs, when Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game and seventh goal of the series.\n\nDue to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a \"Death Valley\" for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those from the Wales Conference.\n\nWith the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would make only brief appearances during the regular season. At this time, both franchises were facing financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league.

The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators' first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators' highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL's worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.\n\nThe Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators' Eric Gryba laid out Montreal's Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators' coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens' coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a \"lack of respect.\" Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn't care what that \"bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.\" In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal's dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.\n\nTwo years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game.

Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa.","notesFormatted":"The rivalry began, just like Toronto and Ottawa, in the early days of the NHL. The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators' first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators' highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL's worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.<BR><BR>The Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators' Eric Gryba laid out Montreal's Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators' coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens' coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a \"lack of respect.\" Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn't care what that \"bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.\" In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal's dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.<BR><BR>Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal.

Washington won game five to stave off elimination, but in game six, the Islanders won 5–3 to take the series in six. But, the win came at a price as Pierre Turgeon suffered a shoulder injury of a vicious check by Washington's Dale Hunter after scoring a goal to put the game and series out of reach.

The two teams have competed in MLB's American League (AL) for over 100 seasons and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports. In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the "Curse of the Bambino", which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States. Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had featured one or both of the AL East rivals since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).<BR><BR>The Yankees and the Red Sox finished tied for first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker game for the division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.<BR><BR>The Yankees–Red Sox match-up is regarded by some sports journalists as the greatest rivalry in sports. Games between the two teams often generate considerable interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. Many national networks, including ESPN and Fox Sports, broadcast the games on the weekend. Yankees–Red Sox games are some of the most-watched MLB games each season. Outside of baseball, the rivalry between the two teams has led to violence between fans, along with attention from politicians and other athletes."},{"team":"Los Angeles Dodgers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Dodgers","teamAbb":"LAD","teamNotes":"f.

However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.

The two teams have competed in MLB's American League (AL) for over 100 seasons and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports. In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the "Curse of the Bambino", which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States. Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had featured one or both of the AL East rivals since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).<BR><BR>The Yankees and the Red Sox finished tied for first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker game for the division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.<BR><BR>The Yankees–Red Sox match-up is regarded by some sports journalists as the greatest rivalry in sports.

Sox rivalry, Celtics–Knicks rivalry and Jets–Patriots rivalry – had its peak during the 1970s, but saw a resurgence in the 2010s. In the Original Six era, the teams had six matchups, with the Rangers only winning in 1928 and 1940 – both on the way to a Stanley Cup title. Between 1970 and 1973, where the Rangers' GAG line and the Bruins led by Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito had strong showings; the teams met three times, with the highest point being the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Bruins won in six games.

In 2000, the Lakers were the best team in the league. However, the 8th-seeded Kings surprised everyone and pushed them in the first round, but lost the series 3–2. After the Kings traded for Doug Christie the Kings looked poise to challenge the reigning, defending champion Lakers, but In 2001, the Lakers swept the Kings in the Western Conference semifinals. However the Kings traded for Mike Bibby & earned the top playoff seed in the 2002 NBA Playoffs. In the 2002 Western Conference Finals, the Kings went toe-to-toe with the back-to-back NBA Champion Lakers. In one of the most memorable playoff series of all time, & numerous buzzer beaters Sacramento was favored and went up 3–2 in the series. The Kings lost Game 6 at Staples Center in Los Angeles on what many call the most controversial Playoff game of all time. As Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the face,Sacramento lost Game 7 in Sacramento in OT, & the Lakers would end up three-peating. NBA expert Roland Beech analyzed the calls and stated that he found that the controversial calls favored the Lakers not in huge numbers (9 total calls), but a lopsided (7–2) rate, however many believe the NBA pushed for a Game 7 seeing as how the Finals looked to be a lopsided series whether it was the Kings or the Lakers playing the Nets. Fights would occur in the ongoing years including the Rick Fox & Doug Christie famous brawl. As well & Shaq dissing Sacramento. Fans hated each other as well. However, as the Kings have fell from atop the Western Conference powerhouses as has the rivalry in recent years. Both the Lakers and Kings have made serious declines, but it has been stated that DeMarcus Cousins wants to be traded to the Lakers in the coming future."},{"team":"Les Canadiens de

The 2 teams were considered the best in the entire American League, and met 4 times in the ALCS, from 1976 to 1980. The first 2 championships between the 2 teams ended in 5 games, with the 1976 edition ending on a memorable Chris Chambliss walk-off homerun in the 9th inning. The 1977 edition would end on yet another Yankees comeback, battling down 2 games to 1 and rallying in the final 2 innings in Kansas City, down 1–3, and winning 5–3, and going on to win the 1977 World Series. However, in 1980, the roles would be reversed, with Kansas City sweeping New York, though would fall to the Philadelphia in the World Series.<BR><BR>Perhaps the most infamous moment between the 2 teams though, was the Pine Tar Incident, in which George Brett blasted a 2 run home run in a game between the 2 teams on July 24, 1983 in Yankee Stadium. Yankees skipper Billy Martin protested the home run, noticing a large amount of pine tar on Brett's bat. The umpires agreed with Martin, ruling the amount of pine tar exceeded what was allowed, and therefore Brett was called out. The Royals protested this decision, and AL president at the time Lee MacPhail agreed, and restarted the game after Brett's home run on August 18, with the Royals holding on to a 5-4 lead.

With the score tied 2-2, two outs, and Rougned Odor on third base, Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin accidentally hit the bat of Rangers outfielder Shin Soo Choo on his throw back to the mound, and Odor came around to score on the error. After a lengthy review process, the umpires determined that Odor should be allowed to score, infuriating the Toronto crowd; Choo would strike out on the next pitch to end the inning. In the bottom half, with Martin leading off, he hit a ground ball that was bobbled by Elvis Andrus and reached base. The next batter, Kevin Pillar, hit a grounder to Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland who's low throw could not be handled by Andrus, leading to another error and two men on, nobody out, with Ryan Goins coming to the plate. Goins bunted the ball to the third base side, where it was fielded by Adrian Beltre, who threw to Andrus covering third base. Andrus again kicked the ball, his second error of the inning, to load the bases, with still nobody out. After Ben Revere hit a weak grounder which Texas cut down the run at the plate to get the first out, Sam Dyson came on to pitch with the bases still loaded, but one out. Jays third baseman and 2015 AL MVP Josh Donaldson hit a flare to the right side, and Odor misplayed the ball, leading to the tying run crossing the plate. However, on the same play, he was able to recover in time to throw to second base for the second out, bringing up slugging Jays outfielder Jose Bautista with runners on the corners and two outs. On a 1-1 count, Bautista smoked a line drive home run to left field to put Toronto ahead 6-3, and did a dramatic bat flip to celebrate. The Rangers took offense to Bautista's actions, and the benches cleared. The same score would hold the rest of the game, sending the Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series, and the Rangers back home.<BR><BR>The following season, on May 15, 2016, the two teams met again for the final time of the regular season, at Globe Life Park in Arlington, home of the Rangers. In the top of the eighth inning, with the Blue Jays batting but the Rangers leading 7-6, pitcher Matt Bush hit Jose Bautista with a pitch. Two batters later, Justin Smoak was at bat for Toronto. With one out, and Bautista on first, Smoak hit a ground ball to Beltre at third base, who relayed to Odor at second, and then to Moreland at first to complete the inning ending double play. However, on that play, Bautista took a hard slide into Odor at second, which Odor took exception to. After some pushing and shoving, Odor punched Bautista in the face with a right hook, and the benches cleared. For their roles in the altercation, Odor was suspended eight games; Bautista one. Following the Blue Jays defeat of the Baltimore Orioles in the 2016 American League Wild Card Game, the Rangers and Blue Jays met once again in the 2016 American League Division Series where once again, the Blue Jays defeated the Rangers in a sweep 3 games to 0."},{"team":"Chicago White Sox","teamLocation":"Chicago","teamName":"White

The two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, they account for 33 of the 71 championships in NBA history.

The 2 teams were considered the best in the entire American League, and met 4 times in the ALCS, from 1976 to 1980. The first 2 championships between the 2 teams ended in 5 games, with the 1976 edition ending on a memorable Chris Chambliss walk-off homerun in the 9th inning. The 1977 edition would end on yet another Yankees comeback, battling down 2 games to 1 and rallying in the final 2 innings in Kansas City, down 1–3, and winning 5–3, and going on to win the 1977 World Series. However, in 1980, the roles would be reversed, with Kansas City sweeping New York, though would fall to the Philadelphia in the World Series.<BR><BR>Perhaps the most infamous moment between the 2 teams though, was the Pine Tar Incident, in which George Brett blasted a 2 run home run in a game between the 2 teams on July 24, 1983 in Yankee Stadium. Yankees skipper Billy Martin protested the home run, noticing a large amount of pine tar on Brett's bat. The umpires agreed with Martin, ruling the amount of pine tar exceeded what was allowed, and therefore Brett was called out. The Royals protested this decision, and AL president at the time Lee MacPhail agreed, and restarted the game after Brett's home run on August 18, with the Royals holding on to a 5-4 lead. The rivalry would have been renewed had the Yankees defeated the Astros in the 2015 wild card match."},{"team":"Boston Red Sox","teamLocation":"Boston","teamName":"Red Sox","teamAbb":"BOS","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"38.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Tampa Bay Rays","opponent":"rays","opponentWins":"rays143","league":"MLB","wins":"192","oWins":"143","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"143","oLosses":"192","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1688","oFor":"1388","against":"1388","oAgainst":"1688","gamesPlayed":"335","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Boston, MA","stateAbb":"MA","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","lat":"42.35","lng":"-71.10","illX":"1278.68","illY":"623.09","cBack":"#002244","cOutline":"#C60C30","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"redSox","bothTeamsBackwards":"rays-redSox","bothTeams":"redSox-rays","id":"redSox192","extraClass":"sox boston-sox","oldClass":"mlb baseball  boston-red-sox bos   ma massachusetts united-states sox boston-sox","class":"mlb baseball  boston-red-sox bos   ma massachusetts united-states sox boston-sox redSox-rays","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks12" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 35, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "braves35" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 25, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "orioles25" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 1191, "losses": 990, "opponentWins": "orioles1191" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "cubs5" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 976, "losses": 938, "opponentWins": "whiteSox976" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 9, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "reds9" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 977, "losses": 1036, "opponentWins": "indians977" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 10, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "rockies10" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 1033, "losses": 969, "opponentWins": "tigers1033" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 24, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "astros24" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 233, "losses": 231, "opponentWins": "royals233" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 338, "losses": 302, "opponentWins": "angels338" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 8, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "dodgers8" }, { "opponent": "Miami Marlins", "wins": 22, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "marlins22" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 218, "losses": 188, "opponentWins": "brewers218" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 968, "losses": 935, "opponentWins": "twins968" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "mets13" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 973, "losses": 1169, "opponentWins": "yankees973" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 1072, "losses": 878, "opponentWins": "athletics1072" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 36, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "phillies36" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "pirates5" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 12, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "padres12" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 11, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "sfGiants11" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 235, "losses": 174, "opponentWins": "mariners235" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "cardinals4" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 192, "losses": 143, "opponentWins": "rays192" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 340, "losses": 312, "opponentWins": "tRangers340" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 325, "losses": 272, "opponentWins": "blueJays325" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 15, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "nationals15" } ],"rivalryNotes":"While not as nationally famous as some matchups, the Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays also have a rivalry that has been the focus of some memorable incidents plus, the two teams met in the 2008 ALCS with the Rays winning the series en route to their first World Series appearance:"},{"team":"Los Angeles Dodgers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Dodgers","teamAbb":"LAD","teamNotes":"f.

This can be traced to a fall game where Dodgers reliever Hong-Chih Kuo threw at the Diamondbacks' Gerardo Parra, who took exception to it – and later hit a home run off Kuo, sparking harsh words from the Dodgers (particularly Clayton Kershaw, who screamed at Parra all the way to home plate). Kershaw, in turn, hit Parra with a pitch the following night; in their next game together in May 2012, the D-Backs' Ian Kennedy retaliated. However the rivalry hit a fever pitch in June 2013, when Kennedy hit the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, prompting Zack Greinke to retaliate by hitting Miguel Montero. However, Kennedy then proceeded to hit Greinke himself, and a furious bench-clearing brawl began. Later that fall, the Dodgers clinched the NL West title – at Chase Field, the home of the Diamondbacks. After the game, Dodger players jumped into the pool at the Diamondbacks' home ballpark; no brawls occurred (the opposing players and fans had all left), but many Arizona players and supporters, even Senator John McCain, (to which Dodgers reliever Brian Wilson shot back that the one-time presidential candidate "knows a thing or two about coming in second") expressed extreme displeasure at this "arrogant, immature" display. Fuel was added to the fire when in 2016, Dodgers ace, Zack Greinke left town for Arizona after the Dodgers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs earlier that year."},{"team":"Milwaukee

develop a hated, & competitive rivalry with the Lakers in the 2000s. In 2000, the Lakers were the best team in the league. However, the 8th-seeded Kings surprised everyone and pushed them in the first round, but lost the series 3–2. After the Kings traded for Doug Christie the Kings looked poise to challenge the reigning, defending champion Lakers, but In 2001, the Lakers swept the Kings in the Western Conference semifinals. However the Kings traded for Mike Bibby & earned the top playoff seed in the 2002 NBA Playoffs. In the 2002 Western Conference Finals, the Kings went toe-to-toe with the back-to-back NBA Champion Lakers. In one of the most memorable playoff series of all time, & numerous buzzer beaters Sacramento was favored and went up 3–2 in the series. The Kings lost Game 6 at Staples Center in Los Angeles on what many call the most controversial Playoff game of all time. As Kobe Bryant elbowed Mike Bibby in the face,Sacramento lost Game 7 in Sacramento in OT, & the Lakers would end up three-peating. NBA expert Roland Beech analyzed the calls and stated that he found that the controversial calls favored the Lakers not in huge numbers (9 total calls), but a lopsided (7–2) rate, however many believe the NBA pushed for a Game 7 seeing as how the Finals looked to be a lopsided series whether it was the Kings or the Lakers playing the Nets. Fights would occur in the ongoing years including the Rick Fox & Doug Christie famous brawl. As well & Shaq dissing Sacramento. Fans hated each other as well. However, as the Kings have fell from atop the Western Conference powerhouses as has the rivalry in recent years. Both the Lakers and Kings have made serious declines, but it has been stated that DeMarcus Cousins wants to be traded to the Lakers in the coming future."},{"team":"Los Angeles

This can be traced to a fall game where Dodgers reliever Hong-Chih Kuo threw at the Diamondbacks' Gerardo Parra, who took exception to it – and later hit a home run off Kuo, sparking harsh words from the Dodgers (particularly Clayton Kershaw, who screamed at Parra all the way to home plate). Kershaw, in turn, hit Parra with a pitch the following night; in their next game together in May 2012, the D-Backs' Ian Kennedy retaliated. However the rivalry hit a fever pitch in June 2013, when Kennedy hit the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, prompting Zack Greinke to retaliate by hitting Miguel Montero. However, Kennedy then proceeded to hit Greinke himself, and a furious bench-clearing brawl began. Later that fall, the Dodgers clinched the NL West title – at Chase Field, the home of the Diamondbacks. After the game, Dodger players jumped into the pool at the Diamondbacks' home ballpark; no brawls occurred (the opposing players and fans had all left), but many Arizona players and supporters, even Senator John McCain, (to which Dodgers reliever Brian Wilson shot back that the one-time presidential candidate "knows a thing or two about coming in second") expressed extreme displeasure at this "arrogant, immature" display. Fuel was added to the fire when in 2016, Dodgers ace, Zack Greinke left town for Arizona after the Dodgers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs earlier that year."},{"team":"Los Angeles

Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers are rival teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The two Pacific Division teams both play their home games at Staples Center in Los Angeles, inspiring their matchups to sometimes be called the "Hallway Series". The Lakers relocated from Minneapolis in 1960, while the Clippers moved from San Diego in 1984. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. The Lakers have won 11 of their 16 NBA championships since moving to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Clippers have made the playoffs only eight times since 1984 and were long considered the laughingstock of the NBA; in the history of the franchise, they have never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Some contended that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful. For the first time in 20 years, the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers in 2012–13. This was the first of four straight season series victories for the Clippers, which included season sweeps in both 2014-15 and 2015-16.

However, the rivalry began to grow in intensity during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when both teams became huge playoff contenders. This was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.

He later apologized halfheartedly for those comments, saying that "the vast majority of the people in Saskatchewan have no idea how to play the banjo." This further fueled the Winnipeg–Saskatchewan football rivalry and has made the rematch game even more of an event. The game is sponsored by the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation. The game has been sold out every year since 2005.

The rivalry would develop in the late 80's when they had intense division battles. In 1988, the Red Wings would defeat the Blues in five games in the Norris division final. The rivalry really heated up in the 90's. In 1991, the Blues would defeat the Red Wings in 7 games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3–1 deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996–98; all three, which the Red Wings won. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3–2 advantage and it looked like the Blues would upset the Wings in Game 6, but the Wings would win the last two games including a double overtime victory in Game 7. This would also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season.

the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The two basketball teams have played each other every year since the Bulls first joined the NBA in 1966. However, the rivalry began to grow in intensity during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when both teams became huge playoff contenders. This was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams. The two teams met in the playoffs seven times between 1981 and 1996, with the Bulls winning six of those series. They have not met in the playoffs since 1996. The rivalry was somewhat revived when the Bulls traded Chicago native and former MVP Derrick Rose to the Knicks and New York signed former Bulls all-star Joakim Noah in the off-season of 2016."},{"team":"Philadelphia Flyers","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Flyers","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"63.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"Battle of the Broads","opponentTeam":"New York Rangers","opponent":"nyRangers","opponentWins":"nyRangers127","league":"NHL","wins":"121","oWins":"128","ties":"37","oTies":"37","losses":"119","oLosses":"113","otLosses":"9","oOtLosses":"8","for":"840","oFor":"847","against":"847","oAgainst":"840","gamesPlayed":"286","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"984.40","illY":"1125.50","cBack":"#F4793E","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"flyers","bothTeamsBackwards":"nyRangers-flyers","bothTeams":"flyers-nyRangers","id":"flyers121","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly","class":"nhl ice hockey  philadelphia-flyers phi   pa pennsylvania united-states philly flyers-nyRangers","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 10, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "ducks10" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 68, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "bruins68" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 85, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "sabres85" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 80, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "hurricanes80" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "blueJackets9" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 59, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "flames59" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 60, "losses": 46, "opponentWins": "blackhawks60" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 37, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "barons37" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 38, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "avalanche38" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 63, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "redWings63" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 33, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers33" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 86, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "laKings86" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 72, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "canadiens72" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 110, "losses": 94, "opponentWins": "devils110" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 12, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "predators12" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 134, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "islanders134" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 121, "losses": 119, "opponentWins": "nyRangers121" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 43, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "senators43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 45, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "coyotes45" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 151, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "penguins151" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks14" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 87, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "blues87" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 93, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs93" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 71, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "canucks71" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 39, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets39" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 110, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "capitals110" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Flyers–Rangers rivalry (also commonly referred to as Broadway versus Broad Street) is one of the most storied and well known rivalries in the National Hockey League.

The rivalry would develop in the late 80's when they had intense division battles. In 1988, the Red Wings would defeat the Blues in five games in the Norris division final. The rivalry really heated up in the 90's. In 1991, the Blues would defeat the Red Wings in 7 games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3–1 deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996–98; all three, which the Red Wings won. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3–2 advantage and it looked like the Blues would upset the Wings in Game 6, but the Wings would win the last two games including a double overtime victory in Game 7. This would also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season. They met during the playoffs in 2002 in the conference semifinals. The Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games as part of their 2002 Stanley Cup run.

They were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the dominant squad in their inaugural season, finishing with 39 wins and 92 points and making it to the Stanley Cup semifinals. The following year the Oilers became the dominant franchise when the Oilers shot to the top of the Smythe Division and Wayne Gretzky started to shatter NHL records (including his own).<BR><BR>The rivalry was especially bitter in the second half of the 1980s. For much of this time, the Oilers and Flames were the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and by some accounts in the entire league. One of the two teams represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals for eight consecutive years from 1983 to 1990 (Oilers 6 times, Flames twice). During this time, the Oilers and Flames won each Stanley Cup between 1984 and 1990, with the exception of 1986, when the Flames lost to the Montreal Canadiens. The Oilers won five of those seven cups, a feat that has not been repeated since. They are recognized as the NHL's last dynasty, with lineups that featured legends like Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, and Mark Messier. The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in 1989, led by superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour and Mike Vernon. This was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they face each other in the first or second round rather than in the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that the other two playoff qualifiers from the Smythe would have to get past either the Oilers or Flames – or both – to make the conference finals. Also, the Stanley Cup was awarded in the province from 1984 to 1988.<BR><BR>The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991, on their way to two of their five Stanley Cups. The Flames defeated the Oilers in the 1986 NHL playoffs; game 7 was decided by rookie Oiler defenceman Steve Smith accidentally scoring on his own goal (credited to Perry Berezan), which ignited the rivalry to a new level. The Flames were favored in the 1988 playoffs, having won the Presidents' Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup. 1991 was the last year the teams met in the playoffs, when Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game and seventh goal of the series.<BR><BR>Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a "Death Valley" for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those from the Wales Conference.<BR><BR>With the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would make only brief appearances during the regular season. At this time, both franchises were facing financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league. Indeed, many experts were predicting the demise of all Canadian teams except the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks. These fears were proved partially justified, as both the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets relocated to American cities, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.<BR><BR>It took well over a decade for either team to return to anything near the form they had exhibited in the 1980s. The Flames advanced to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, falling in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Flames became the first team in the modern era of the NHL to defeat all three division winners en route to the Stanley Cup final. The next Stanley Cup final, (played in 2006 due to the NHL lockout of 2005) saw the Edmonton Oilers fall in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes. The Oilers became the first 8th seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to the Stanley Cup final. However, the Oilers have not returned to the playoffs since then. The Flames would make the playoffs every year until 2009, but would then go six years without a playoff berth.<BR><BR>The 2009–10 NHL season marked the first time either team has won every game between the two, the Flames were 6-0 in regular season games against the Oilers. This wasn't the first time the season series was a lopsided affair. The Oilers defeated the Flames 7 times in the 1983–84 season series and 6 times in 1984–85 and 1985–86. The 2009–10 NHL season also marked the first-ever trade between the two rivals, with Steve Staios (then of Edmonton) and Aaron Johnson (then of Calgary) switching teams on March 3, 2010."},{"team":"New York Knicks","teamLocation":"New

At the time, the team was known as the New York Nets and played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Long Island. The team became the New Jersey Nets the following season when they relocated to suburban New Jersey, playing temporarily in Piscataway before moving to Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford in 1981, their home until 2010. The Nets played their final two seasons in New Jersey at Prudential Center in downtown Newark. The rivalry became an intra-city series when the Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012.<BR><BR>After the Nets' move to Brooklyn, due to the close proximity of the two teams and the overall histories of Brooklyn and Manhattan, media outlets have dubbed the rivalry the Battle of the Boroughs, or Clash of the Boroughs.

The teams first met in the 1991 Patrick Division Finals, when the Penguins defeated the Capitals in 5 en route to capturing the Stanley Cup. In fact, all four league titles won by Pittsburgh have included a round against Washington. The rivalry was intense during the early 2000s when the Penguins beat the Capitals in the first round in consecutive seasons (1999-00, 2000–01), and seemed to amplify more after the trade of Jaromir Jagr.<BR><BR>More recently, with the drafting and emergence of Alexander Ovechkin in Washington, and Sidney Crosby in Pittsburgh, the rivalry has heated up again, with controversial comments that Alexander Semin made about Crosby in the media and physical altercations taking place between Ovechkin and Malkin during games. One of the best series to date between the teams was the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which the Capitals took a 2–0 series lead before letting it go once again to be downed in 7 games, ending with a 6–2 Game 7 loss at the Verizon Center. Just like in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins defeated the Capitals in the playoffs en route to the Stanley Cup. The two teams faced off at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic hosted in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field, with the Capitals emerging victorious 3–1. The Capitals and Penguins completed their second playoff confrontation in the Ovechkin-Crosby era in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs with the Penguins winning in six games, again preceding Pittsburgh's fourth Stanley Cup title."},{"team":"New Jersey Devils","teamLocation":"New Jersey","teamName":"Devils","teamAbb":"NJ","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"71.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"Battle of the Jersey Turnpike","opponentTeam":"Philadelphia Flyers","opponent":"flyers","opponentWins":"flyers104","league":"NHL","wins":"105","oWins":"110","ties":"18","oTies":"18","losses":"104","oLosses":"94","otLosses":"6","oOtLosses":"11","for":"689","oFor":"766","against":"766","oAgainst":"689","gamesPlayed":"233","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Newark, NJ","stateAbb":"NJ","state":"New Jersey","country":"United States","lat":"40.73","lng":"-74.17","illX":"1083.74","illY":"875.29","cBack":"#E03A3E","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"devils","bothTeamsBackwards":"flyers-devils","bothTeams":"devils-flyers","id":"devils105","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-jersey-devils nj new jersey devils nj new jersey united-states","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-jersey-devils nj new jersey devils nj new jersey united-states devils-flyers","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 17, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "ducks17" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 50, "losses": 74, "opponentWins": "bruins50" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 59, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "sabres59" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 71, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "hurricanes71" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 12, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets12" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 25, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "flames25" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 39, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "blackhawks39" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "barons6" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 35, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche35" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 43, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "dStars43" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 39, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "redWings39" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 32, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "oilers32" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 52, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "panthers52" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 35, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "laKings35" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wild12" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 65, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "canadiens65" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 14, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "predators14" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 86, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "islanders86" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 97, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "nyRangers97" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 105, "losses": 104, "opponentWins": "flyers105" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 26, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "coyotes26" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 111, "losses": 93, "opponentWins": "penguins111" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 19, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "sharks19" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 37, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "blues37" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 55, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "lightning55" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 48, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs48" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 35, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "canucks35" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 32, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "wJets32" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 87, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "capitals87" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Devils–Flyers rivalry is a rivalry between two teams in the NHL's Metropolitan Division.

At the time, the team was known as the New York Nets and played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Long Island. The team became the New Jersey Nets the following season when they relocated to suburban New Jersey, playing temporarily in Piscataway before moving to Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford in 1981, their home until 2010. The Nets played their final two seasons in New Jersey at Prudential Center in downtown Newark. The rivalry became an intra-city series when the Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012.<BR><BR>After the Nets' move to Brooklyn, due to the close proximity of the two teams and the overall histories of Brooklyn and Manhattan, media outlets have dubbed the rivalry the Battle of the Boroughs, or Clash of the Boroughs.

At the time, the team was known as the New York Nets and played at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Long Island. The team became the New Jersey Nets the following season when they relocated to suburban New Jersey, playing temporarily in Piscataway before moving to Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford in 1981, their home until 2010. The Nets played their final two seasons in New Jersey at Prudential Center in downtown Newark. The rivalry became an intra-city series when the Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012.<BR><BR>After the Nets' move to Brooklyn, due to the close proximity of the two teams and the overall histories of Brooklyn and Manhattan, media outlets have dubbed the rivalry the Battle of the Boroughs, or Clash of the Boroughs.

They were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the dominant squad in their inaugural season, finishing with 39 wins and 92 points and making it to the Stanley Cup semifinals. The following year the Oilers became the dominant franchise when the Oilers shot to the top of the Smythe Division and Wayne Gretzky started to shatter NHL records (including his own).<BR><BR>The rivalry was especially bitter in the second half of the 1980s. For much of this time, the Oilers and Flames were the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and by some accounts in the entire league. One of the two teams represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals for eight consecutive years from 1983 to 1990 (Oilers 6 times, Flames twice). During this time, the Oilers and Flames won each Stanley Cup between 1984 and 1990, with the exception of 1986, when the Flames lost to the Montreal Canadiens. The Oilers won five of those seven cups, a feat that has not been repeated since. They are recognized as the NHL's last dynasty, with lineups that featured legends like Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, and Mark Messier. The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in 1989, led by superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour and Mike Vernon. This was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they face each other in the first or second round rather than in the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that the other two playoff qualifiers from the Smythe would have to get past either the Oilers or Flames – or both – to make the conference finals. Also, the Stanley Cup was awarded in the province from 1984 to 1988.<BR><BR>The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991, on their way to two of their five Stanley Cups. The Flames defeated the Oilers in the 1986 NHL playoffs; game 7 was decided by rookie Oiler defenceman Steve Smith accidentally scoring on his own goal (credited to Perry Berezan), which ignited the rivalry to a new level. The Flames were favored in the 1988 playoffs, having won the Presidents' Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup. 1991 was the last year the teams met in the playoffs, when Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game and seventh goal of the series.<BR><BR>Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a "Death Valley" for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those from the Wales Conference.<BR><BR>With the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would make only brief appearances during the regular season. At this time, both franchises were facing financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league. Indeed, many experts were predicting the demise of all Canadian teams except the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks. These fears were proved partially justified, as both the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets relocated to American cities, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.<BR><BR>It took well over a decade for either team to return to anything near the form they had exhibited in the 1980s. The Flames advanced to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, falling in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Flames became the first team in the modern era of the NHL to defeat all three division winners en route to the Stanley Cup final. The next Stanley Cup final, (played in 2006 due to the NHL lockout of 2005) saw the Edmonton Oilers fall in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes. The Oilers became the first 8th seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to the Stanley Cup final. However, the Oilers have not returned to the playoffs since then. The Flames would make the playoffs every year until 2009, but would then go six years without a playoff berth.<BR><BR>The 2009–10 NHL season marked the first time either team has won every game between the two, the Flames were 6-0 in regular season games against the Oilers. This wasn't the first time the season series was a lopsided affair. The Oilers defeated the Flames 7 times in the 1983–84 season series and 6 times in 1984–85 and 1985–86. The 2009–10 NHL season also marked the first-ever trade between the two rivals, with Steve Staios (then of Edmonton) and Aaron Johnson (then of Calgary) switching teams on March 3, 2010."},{"team":"Chicago

But the rivalry truly began in the 2003–04 season. The Pacers finished with a league best 61 wins and were led by Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Reggie Miller, and coached by Rick Carlisle. Carlisle had been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, and Richard Hamilton, and coached by Larry Brown. Indiana won the first 3 matchups in the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit.<BR><BR>They met in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana narrowly won Game 1, thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed, unimpressed, stated "We will win Game 2" during an interview before the second game (locally known as the "Guaran-Sheed" victory). Late in Game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of Game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4-2, and went on to win the NBA title.<BR><BR>On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, what has become known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl took place. All involved were suspended for varying lengths. Artest was suspended for the rest of the season (73 games).<BR><BR>That year teams split the four regular season meetings.

Westwood was quoted in the media as saying that people from Regina were "a bunch of banjo-pickin' inbreds." He later apologized halfheartedly for those comments, saying that "the vast majority of the people in Saskatchewan have no idea how to play the banjo." This further fueled the Winnipeg–Saskatchewan football rivalry and has made the rematch game even more of an event. The game is sponsored by the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation. The game has been sold out every year since 2005. As of the 2016 season, Winnipeg leads the series 7-6.<BR><BR>As on Labour Day weekend when many Winnipeg fans visit Regina to support the Bombers, many Saskatchewan fans visit Winnipeg the following weekend to support the 'Riders. Many come, tongue-in-cheek, with banjos.<BR><BR>Despite not being an official event, the Canadian Football League website promotes the game by referring to it as "Banjo Bowl" in some of its online coverage as does the league's official television broadcaster, TSN. In 2013, the Premier of Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, joined in the spirit of the event by posting a video on his YouTube channel making reference to the rivalry and the Banjo Bowl game."},{"team":"Detroit

swept the Pacers in three straight games on their way to their second straight NBA championship. But the rivalry truly began in the 2003–04 season. The Pacers finished with a league best 61 wins and were led by Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Reggie Miller, and coached by Rick Carlisle. Carlisle had been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, and Richard Hamilton, and coached by Larry Brown. Indiana won the first 3 matchups in the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit.<BR><BR>They met in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana narrowly won Game 1, thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed, unimpressed, stated "We will win Game 2" during an interview before the second game (locally known as the "Guaran-Sheed" victory). Late in Game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of Game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4-2, and went on to win the NBA title.<BR><BR>On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, what has become known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl took place. All involved were suspended for varying lengths. Artest was suspended for the rest of the season (73 games).<BR><BR>That year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the Eastern Conference semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers, blew an 18-point lead, but still won Game 3 in Indianapolis.

The Islanders won the Division semifinals 3–1 in 1983, the Division Finals 4–1 in 1984, and the Division semifinals 3–2 after being down two games in 1985. The Capitals defeated the Islanders in 1986 in a three-game sweep.<BR><BR>In 1987, the teams had one of the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Islanders forced Game 7 after being down 3–1 in the series. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for New York and Bob Mason for Washington went at it save for save, stopping every scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3–2 victory and a 4–3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic.<BR><BR>Six years later in 1993, the teams met once again, the Capitals finished second in the division with 93 points, six points ahead of the Islanders. Washington won the opener by a score of 3–1, before the Islanders won the next three games, all in overtime, including a pair in double OT to take a 3–1 series lead.

Among the first-year Oilers' players included a young Wayne Gretzky, who instantly challenged for the Art Ross Trophy against the Kings' Marcel Dionne. In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky's 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's full count of 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught "that an assist was good as a goal."<BR><BR>The two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981–82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists). The Oilers also jumped to the top of their division despite playing in their third NHL season and had the third best record in the league. The Kings, after a fairly impressive 1980–81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL. They only made the playoffs, being fourth in the same division as the Oilers, because the Colorado Rockies had an even worse record in their last season. This set the stage for the top-seeded, heavily-favored Oilers to meet in the first round against the Kings. After a two-game split in Edmonton, Game 3 in Los Angeles began with a commanding Oilers 5–0 lead after two periods. But in a miraculous comeback, the Kings managed to tie the game 5–5 in the third period, scoring the tying goal with five seconds left on a two-man advantage. The Kings would later win the game 6–5 in overtime. This game is often referred to as the Miracle on Manchester. The Oilers struck back in Game 4 to send the series back to Edmonton for the deciding game in a best-of-five series. However, it was the Kings who upset the Oilers and advanced to the next round.<BR><BR>For the next two seasons, the Kings would miss the playoffs completely while the Oilers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983 and won their first Stanley Cup in 1984. Both finals were played against the dynasty New York Islanders. The two teams finally met again in 1985, but this time the Oilers defeated the Kings in three straight games. The Oilers would go on to win their second straight Stanley Cup. They met again in 1987 under a new best-of-seven playoff format for the first round, and again the Oilers would win, this time in five games, and again the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. In 1988, the Kings were again blown out of the first round, but by the Calgary Flames, while Gretzky led the Oilers to another Stanley Cup.<BR><BR>The entire world of sports was shocked on August 9, 1988 upon the announcement of the Oilers trading Wayne Gretzky along with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley, to the Kings for two rising young players (Jimmy Carson and Martin Gelinas), three first-round draft picks, and $15 million in US dollars.<BR><BR>Gretzky would lead the Kings in the 1988–89 season to vast improvements. For the first time, the Kings had a better season record than Edmonton, finishing second in the Smythe Division over the third place Oilers. This also led to another first round match up between the Kings and Oilers. This time, it was the Kings, with Gretzky, against the Oilers, and the Kings also had home ice. The Oilers first took command of the series and jumped ahead three games to one above the Kings. But Los Angeles answered back with three straight wins to win the series against Edmonton.<BR><BR>In the next three playoff meetings between the two teams, the Gretzky-led Kings would be eliminated by his former teammates in four, six, and six games respectively. Edmonton also won another Stanley Cup in 1990 after sweeping the Kings in the second round.<BR><BR>After the 1990–91 season, the rivalry would die down as players from the Oilers would move to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy would rejoin Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, and others would move to the New York Rangers and go on a Stanley Cup winning run in 1994. Furthermore, the two Pacific Division teams have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been regularly competitive at the same time, thus keeping what once was an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. And Edmonton has not made a postseason appearance ever since that 2006 run, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014."},{"team":"New York Rangers","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Rangers","teamAbb":"NYR","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"95.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Washington Capitals","opponent":"capitals","opponentWins":"capitals98","league":"NHL","wins":"95","oWins":"98","ties":"18","oTies":"18","losses":"91","oLosses":"89","otLosses":"7","oOtLosses":"6","for":"715","oFor":"720","against":"720","oAgainst":"715","gamesPlayed":"211","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.75","lng":"-73.99","illX":"1145.15","illY":"822.08","cBack":"#0161AB","cOutline":"#E51837","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"nyRangers","bothTeamsBackwards":"capitals-nyRangers","bothTeams":"nyRangers-capitals","id":"nyRangers95","extraClass":"ny-rangers ny","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny nyRangers-capitals","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 14, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "ducks14" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 254, "losses": 289, "opponentWins": "bruins254" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 70, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "sabres70" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 75, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "hurricanes75" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 14, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets14" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 240, "losses": 245, "opponentWins": "blackhawks240" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 217, "losses": 262, "opponentWins": "redWings217" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 67, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "laKings67" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 194, "losses": 328, "opponentWins": "canadiens194" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 28, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "maroons28" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 111, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "devils111" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Americans", "wins": 57, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "americans57" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "islanders125" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 17, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "senators17" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 39, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "senators39" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 128, "losses": 113, "opponentWins": "flyers128" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 6, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "quakers6" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 44, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "coyotes44" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "penguins125" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 18, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "pirates18" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 24, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "sharks24" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "stlEagles5" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 79, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "blues79" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 46, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "lightning46" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 228, "losses": 275, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs228" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 78, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "canucks78" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 28, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "wJets28" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 95, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "capitals95" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Capitals–Rangers rivalry is a rivalry that takes place in the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers.

This is mainly because there were three straight years of playoffs series between these teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The first seeds of the rivalry began with the realignment of the NHL in 1974, placing both teams in the newly formed Smythe Division. For two years, they battled each other for top spot and in 1977, they went down to the wire for the last playoff spot, which Chicago won on a tiebreaker by virtue of having more wins at season's end.<BR><BR>The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock surrender by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson over what he deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals.<BR><BR>They would not meet again until the 2008–09 season. The Blackhawks would eliminate the Canucks in the playoffs that season in the second round and would defeat them again the following season in the same round as part of their 2010 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry reached its peak in the 2011 playoffs, as they met for the third straight year in the first round of the playoffs that year, where the Canucks finally defeated Chicago 4–3. In this series, the Canucks took a 3–0 series only to drop the next three games. In Game 7, the Blackhawks tied it in the final minutes shorthanded, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Canucks forward Alexandre Burrows scored on a slapshot to win the series for the Canucks, as part of their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they ultimately lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The rivalry has died down since then due to the Canucks' regular season play as well as a lack of playoff matches between the two teams."},{"team":"Philadelphia Eagles","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Eagles","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"100.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New York Giants","opponent":"nyGiants","opponentWins":"nyGiants85","league":"NFL","wins":"79","oWins":"84","ties":"2","oTies":"2","losses":"84","oLosses":"79","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"3107","oFor":"3190","against":"3190","oAgainst":"3107","gamesPlayed":"165","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"1030.99","illY":"988.88","cBack":"#003B48","cOutline":"#C0C0C0","cText":"#708090","teamSmall":"eagles","bothTeamsBackwards":"nyGiants-eagles","bothTeams":"eagles-nyGiants","id":"eagles79","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly","class":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly eagles-nyGiants","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "falcons16" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 7, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "bills7" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 11, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "bears11" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 3, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bengals3" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 17, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "browns17" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "cowboys49" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "broncos7" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 16, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "lions16" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 14, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "packers14" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 4, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans4" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "colts8" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars2" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 4, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "chiefs4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 19, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "rams19" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 10, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "vikings10" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 79, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "nyGiants79" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 10, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyJets10" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "raiders6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 47, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "steelers47" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "chargers4" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks7" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "buccaneers8" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "titans7" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 74, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "redskins74" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Colts", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bColts1" }, { "opponent": "Boston Yanks", "wins": 7, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "yanks7" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Tigers", "wins": 6, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "bTigers6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 3, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "reds3" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Texans", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans1" }, { "opponent": "New York Yanks", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyYanks2" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Raiders–Steelers rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers.

In 1984, Mike Gartner lead the Capitals to a three-game sweep of the Flyers in the opening round of the playoffs for the Capitals' first ever playoff series victory, and in the process ending the careers of Bobby Clarke and Bill Barber, the last two players of the Broad Street Bullies era. In 1988, the Capitals trailed the Flyers three games to one in the opening round of the playoffs. Washington would rally to win the next three games to take the series in seven games capped off by Dale Hunter's overtime goal in game seven. The following year, Tim Kerr and Ron Hextall helped the Flyers take down the division champions Capitals.<BR><BR>In the 2000s, the rivalry was reignited by the rebirth of the Alexander Ovechkin-led Capitals, whom the Flyers eliminated in 2008. Since the league-wide realignment in 2013, the rivalry between the teams has started to intensify. During a regular season game in 2013, there was an all-out line-brawl between the two teams. Washington would win the game 7–0. Both teams met in the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Capitals winning the series four games to two."},{"team":"Los Angeles Kings","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Kings","teamAbb":"LAK","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"102.00","rivalryType":"expansion","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Edmonton Oilers","opponent":"oilers","opponentWins":"oilers89","league":"NHL","wins":"81","oWins":"89","ties":"30","oTies":"30","losses":"80","oLosses":"78","otLosses":"9","oOtLosses":"3","for":"720","oFor":"766","against":"766","oAgainst":"720","gamesPlayed":"200","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"34.04","lng":"-118.27","illX":"110.32","illY":"946.71","cBack":"#B2B7BB","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"laKings","bothTeamsBackwards":"oilers-laKings","bothTeams":"laKings-oilers","id":"laKings81","extraClass":"la-kings la","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak los angeles kings ca california united-states la-kings la","class":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak los angeles kings ca california united-states la-kings la laKings-oilers","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 57, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "ducks57" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 42, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "bruins42" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 43, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "sabres43" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 35, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "hurricanes35" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 31, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "blueJackets31" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 94, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "flames94" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 81, "losses": 88, "opponentWins": "blackhawks81" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 64, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "avalanche64" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 87, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "dStars87" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 83, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "redWings83" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 81, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "oilers81" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 17, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "panthers17" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 25, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "wild25" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 32, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "canadiens32" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 54, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "devils54" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 32, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "predators32" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 47, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "islanders47" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 48, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "nyRangers48" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 19, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "senators19" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 43, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "flyers43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 86, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "coyotes86" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 74, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "penguins74" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 62, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sharks62" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 74, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "blues74" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 13, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "lightning13" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 64, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs64" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 107, "losses": 100, "opponentWins": "canucks107" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wJets12" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 57, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "capitals57" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry between the Edmonton Oilers and the Los Angeles Kings began more or less the instant the Oilers began playing in the NHL in the 1979–80 season. Among the first-year Oilers' players included a young Wayne Gretzky, who instantly challenged for the Art Ross Trophy against the Kings' Marcel Dionne. In the end, Gretzky and Dionne were both tied with 137 points, but the award was given to Dionne, who had two more goals (53 vs. Gretzky's 51). It should also be noted that Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's full count of 80. Gretzky remarked during a press conference at which the scoring title was awarded to Dionne that he had been taught "that an assist was good as a goal."<BR><BR>The two teams would not meet in the playoffs until the 1981–82 season. That season, Gretzky shattered the NHL record books with the most points in a season with 212 (92 goals and 120 assists). The Oilers also jumped to the top of their division despite playing in their third NHL season and had the third best record in the league. The Kings, after a fairly impressive 1980–81 season, slumped to having the fifth worst record in the 21-team-NHL. They only made the playoffs, being fourth in the same division as the Oilers, because the Colorado Rockies had an even worse record in their last season. This set the stage for the top-seeded, heavily-favored Oilers to meet in the first round against the Kings. After a two-game split in Edmonton, Game 3 in Los Angeles began with a commanding Oilers 5–0 lead after two periods. But in a miraculous comeback, the Kings managed to tie the game 5–5 in the third period, scoring the tying goal with five seconds left on a two-man advantage. The Kings would later win the game 6–5 in overtime. This game is often referred to as the Miracle on Manchester. The Oilers struck back in Game 4 to send the series back to Edmonton for the deciding game in a best-of-five series. However, it was the Kings who upset the Oilers and advanced to the next round.<BR><BR>For the next two seasons, the Kings would miss the playoffs completely while the Oilers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983 and won their first Stanley Cup in 1984. Both finals were played against the dynasty New York Islanders. The two teams finally met again in 1985, but this time the Oilers defeated the Kings in three straight games. The Oilers would go on to win their second straight Stanley Cup. They met again in 1987 under a new best-of-seven playoff format for the first round, and again the Oilers would win, this time in five games, and again the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. In 1988, the Kings were again blown out of the first round, but by the Calgary Flames, while Gretzky led the Oilers to another Stanley Cup.<BR><BR>The entire world of sports was shocked on August 9, 1988 upon the announcement of the Oilers trading Wayne Gretzky along with Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley, to the Kings for two rising young players (Jimmy Carson and Martin Gelinas), three first-round draft picks, and $15 million in US dollars.<BR><BR>Gretzky would lead the Kings in the 1988–89 season to vast improvements. For the first time, the Kings had a better season record than Edmonton, finishing second in the Smythe Division over the third place Oilers. This also led to another first round match up between the Kings and Oilers. This time, it was the Kings, with Gretzky, against the Oilers, and the Kings also had home ice. The Oilers first took command of the series and jumped ahead three games to one above the Kings. But Los Angeles answered back with three straight wins to win the series against Edmonton.<BR><BR>In the next three playoff meetings between the two teams, the Gretzky-led Kings would be eliminated by his former teammates in four, six, and six games respectively. Edmonton also won another Stanley Cup in 1990 after sweeping the Kings in the second round.<BR><BR>After the 1990–91 season, the rivalry would die down as players from the Oilers would move to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy would rejoin Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, and others would move to the New York Rangers and go on a Stanley Cup winning run in 1994. Furthermore, the two Pacific Division teams have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been regularly competitive at the same time, thus keeping what once was an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. And Edmonton has not made a postseason appearance ever since that 2006 run, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014."},{"team":"Los Angeles Kings","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Kings","teamAbb":"LAK","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"103.00","rivalryType":"historic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks92","league":"NHL","wins":"81","oWins":"93","ties":"17","oTies":"17","losses":"88","oLosses":"75","otLosses":"5","oOtLosses":"6","for":"573","oFor":"626","against":"626","oAgainst":"573","gamesPlayed":"191","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"34.04","lng":"-118.27","illX":"110.32","illY":"946.71","cBack":"#B2B7BB","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"laKings","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-laKings","bothTeams":"laKings-blackhawks","id":"laKings81","extraClass":"la-kings la","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak   ca california united-states la-kings la","class":"nhl ice hockey  los-angeles-kings lak   ca california united-states la-kings la laKings-blackhawks","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 57, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "ducks57" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 42, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "bruins42" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 43, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "sabres43" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 35, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "hurricanes35" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 31, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "blueJackets31" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 94, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "flames94" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 81, "losses": 88, "opponentWins": "blackhawks81" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 64, "losses": 50, "opponentWins": "avalanche64" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 87, "losses": 102, "opponentWins": "dStars87" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 83, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "redWings83" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 81, "losses": 80, "opponentWins": "oilers81" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 17, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "panthers17" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 25, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "wild25" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 32, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "canadiens32" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 54, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "devils54" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 32, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "predators32" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 47, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "islanders47" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 48, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "nyRangers48" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 19, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "senators19" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 43, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "flyers43" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 86, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "coyotes86" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 74, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "penguins74" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 62, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sharks62" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 74, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "blues74" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 13, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "lightning13" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 64, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs64" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 107, "losses": 100, "opponentWins": "canucks107" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wJets12" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 57, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "capitals57" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The rivalry would start in the 1970–71 season, when the Chicago Blackhawks moved to the West Division.

It cooled down after the Hawks and the Kings were in separate divisions. It got intense in the 2012–13 lockout-shortened season, when the Blackhawks spoiled the Kings' banner party on their way to one of the best starts in sports history. The rivalry caught fire when these two teams meet in the Western Conference Finals. The Kings were the defending champions, but their hopes of repeating were dashed as the Hawks would down the Kings in double overtime in game 5. In 2014, the reverse happened; the Blackhawks were defending champs, but the Kings would crush their dreams for a repeat in game 7 also in OT after building a 3–1 series lead."},{"team":"New York

The aggressive nature of those four series, defensive struggles marked by numerous foul calls, and intensely physical play, can be traced to the highly defensive style of Pat Riley, former coach of both teams and the rivalries' central figure.

The series takes its name from the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco.<BR><BR>Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to Cubs–White Sox, or Mets–Yankees games where animosity runs high, though more radical sections of each fanbase does harbor towards the entirety of the other. This, however, is severely limited as many people see the opposing team as no threat to their own; hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from an historic era of their franchises.<BR><BR>The series is also occasionally referred to as the "BART Series" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name "BART Series" has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the "Bay Bridge Series" of the "Battle of the Bay."<BR><BR>Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series which the Athletics won and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of Interleague play in 1997.

The two teams met in the postseason four years in a row from 1997–2000, with the Knicks winning three of those series and the Heat winning one. The teams most recently met in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, which the Heat won in five games.<BR><BR>The Heat–Knicks rivalry was one of the fiercest in the NBA, and Sports Illustrated considered it the third-best NBA rivalry. Prior to the 1997 NBA Playoffs, no two NBA teams had ever met in the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, with each series going to the maximum possible number of games. The aggressive nature of those four series, defensive struggles marked by numerous foul calls, and intensely physical play, can be traced to the highly defensive style of Pat Riley, former coach of both teams and the rivalries' central figure. This 1990s rivalry created some of the most highly anticipated matchups during its short-lived tenure."},{"team":"Dallas Cowboys","teamLocation":"Dallas","teamName":"Cowboys","teamAbb":"DAL","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"110.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Washington Redskins","opponent":"redskins","opponentWins":"redskins44","league":"NFL","wins":"68","oWins":"42","ties":"2","oTies":"2","losses":"42","oLosses":"68","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"2590","oFor":"2162","against":"2162","oAgainst":"2590","gamesPlayed":"112","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Dalls, TX","stateAbb":"TX","state":"Texas","country":"United States","lat":"32.75","lng":"-97.09","illX":"851.62","illY":"1375.23","cBack":"#0D254C","cOutline":"#87909B","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"cowboys","bothTeamsBackwards":"redskins-cowboys","bothTeams":"cowboys-redskins","id":"cowboys68","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nfl american football  dallas-cowboys dal dallas cowboys tx texas united-states","class":"nfl american football  dallas-cowboys dal dallas cowboys tx texas united-states cowboys-redskins","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 14, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "falcons14" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 1, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "ravens1" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bills6" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 9, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "cPanthers9" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "bears13" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 8, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bengals8" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 13, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "browns13" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "broncos4" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "lions12" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 13, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "packers13" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 3, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "texans3" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 10, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "colts10" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 3, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars3" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "chiefs6" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 13, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "rams13" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 12, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "vikings12" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 62, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "nyGiants62" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "nyJets7" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 5, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "raiders5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 62, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "eagles62" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "steelers16" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 6, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "chargers6" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "seahawks10" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 11, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "buccaneers11" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "titans8" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 68, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "redskins68" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Cowboys–Redskins rivalry is a rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins in the National Football League's NFC East division.

This is mainly because there were three straight years of playoffs series between these teams in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The first seeds of the rivalry began with the realignment of the NHL in 1974, placing both teams in the newly formed Smythe Division. For two years, they battled each other for top spot and in 1977, they went down to the wire for the last playoff spot, which Chicago won on a tiebreaker by virtue of having more wins at season's end.<BR><BR>The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals, which is best remembered for a mock surrender by then-Canucks coach Roger Neilson over what he deemed questionable officiating in Game 2, which began the Towel Power tradition in Vancouver and elsewhere in sports. Vancouver prevailed in the series four games to one, as part of their 1982 Cinderella Stanley Cup run. The Blackhawks swept the Canucks in the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals.<BR><BR>They would not meet again until the 2008–09 season. The Blackhawks would eliminate the Canucks in the playoffs that season in the second round and would defeat them again the following season in the same round as part of their 2010 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry reached its peak in the 2011 playoffs, as they met for the third straight year in the first round of the playoffs that year, where the Canucks finally defeated Chicago 4–3. In this series, the Canucks took a 3–0 series only to drop the next three games. In Game 7, the Blackhawks tied it in the final minutes shorthanded, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Canucks forward Alexandre Burrows scored on a slapshot to win the series for the Canucks, as part of their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, in which they ultimately lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The rivalry has died down since then due to the Canucks' regular season play as well as a lack of playoff matches between the two teams."},{"team":"Detroit Red Wings","teamLocation":"Detroit","teamName":"Red Wings","teamAbb":"DET","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"112.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Penguins","opponent":"penguins","opponentWins":"penguins63","league":"NHL","wins":"65","oWins":"68","ties":"16","oTies":"16","losses":"64","oLosses":"62","otLosses":"4","oOtLosses":"3","for":"504","oFor":"523","against":"523","oAgainst":"504","gamesPlayed":"149","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Detroit, MI","stateAbb":"MI","state":"Michigan","country":"United States","lat":"42.33","lng":"-83.05","illX":"806.48","illY":"293.68","cBack":"#E51837","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"redWings","bothTeamsBackwards":"penguins-redWings","bothTeams":"redWings-penguins","id":"redWings65","extraClass":"wings detroit-wings","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  detroit-red-wings det   mi michigan united-states wings detroit-wings","class":"nhl ice hockey  detroit-red-wings det   mi michigan united-states wings detroit-wings redWings-penguins","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 49, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "ducks49" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 254, "losses": 241, "opponentWins": "bruins254" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 62, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "sabres62" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 40, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "hurricanes40" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 54, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "blueJackets54" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 72, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "flames72" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 366, "losses": 268, "opponentWins": "blackhawks366" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 30, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "barons30" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 65, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "avalanche65" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 112, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "dStars112" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 64, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "oilers64" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 19, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "panthers19" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 86, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "laKings86" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 34, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "wild34" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 205, "losses": 278, "opponentWins": "canadiens205" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 19, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "maroons19" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 47, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "devils47" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 54, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "predators54" }, { "opponent": "New York Americans", "wins": 43, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "americans43" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 51, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "islanders51" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 265, "losses": 213, "opponentWins": "nyRangers265" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 12, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "senators12" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 24, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "senators24" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 51, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "flyers51" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 4, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "quakers4" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 68, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "coyotes68" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 65, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "penguins65" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 14, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "pirates14" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 54, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "sharks54" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 3, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "stlEagles3" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 123, "losses": 112, "opponentWins": "blues123" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 29, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "lightning29" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 283, "losses": 276, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs283" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 89, "losses": 55, "opponentWins": "canucks89" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 13, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets13" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 48, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "capitals48" } ],"rivalryNotes":"A much more recent rivalry, these two teams met in back-to-back Stanley Cup Finals in 2008 and 2009.

The rivalry was added to in May, 2015, with head coach Mike Babcock signing with the Leafs (who the Sabres were close to inking a deal with the day prior)."},{"team":"Los Angeles Clippers","teamLocation":"Los Angeles","teamName":"Clippers","teamAbb":"LAC","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"114.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Lakers","opponent":"lakers","opponentWins":"lakers144","league":"NBA","wins":"64","oWins":"144","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"144","oLosses":"64","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"21549","oFor":"22833","against":"22833","oAgainst":"21549","gamesPlayed":"208","leagueLower":"nba","sport":"Basketball","colour":"#669933","city":"Los Angeles, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"34.04","lng":"-118.27","illX":"221.65","illY":"1121.49","cBack":"#ED174C","cOutline":"#006BB6","cText":"#BEC0C2","teamSmall":"clippers","bothTeamsBackwards":"lakers-clippers","bothTeams":"clippers-lakers","id":"clippers64","extraClass":"la-clippers la","oldClass":"nba basketball  los-angeles-clippers lac los angeles clippers ca california united-states la-clippers la","class":"nba basketball  los-angeles-clippers lac los angeles clippers ca california united-states la-clippers la clippers-lakers","info":[ { "opponent": "Atlanta Hawks", "wins": 40, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "hawks40" }, { "opponent": "Boston Celtics", "wins": 38, "losses": 86, "opponentWins": "celtics38" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Nets", "wins": 39, "losses": 48, "opponentWins": "nets39" }, { "opponent": "Charlotte Hornets", "wins": 27, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "hornets27" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bulls", "wins": 48, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "bulls48" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Cavaliers", "wins": 50, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "cavaliers50" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Mavericks", "wins": 58, "losses": 88, "opponentWins": "mavericks58" }, { "opponent": "Denver Nuggets", "wins": 75, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "nuggets75" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Pistons", "wins": 43, "losses": 70, "opponentWins": "pistons43" }, { "opponent": "Golden State Warriors", "wins": 85, "losses": 122, "opponentWins": "warriors85" }, { "opponent": "Houston Rockets", "wins": 73, "losses": 116, "opponentWins": "rockets73" }, { "opponent": "Indiana Pacers", "wins": 32, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "pacers32" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Lakers", "wins": 64, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "lakers64" }, { "opponent": "Memphis Grizzlies", "wins": 41, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "grizzlies41" }, { "opponent": "Miami Heat", "wins": 22, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "heat22" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Bucks", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "bucks49" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Timberwolves", "wins": 57, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "timberwolves57" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Pelicans", "wins": 23, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "pelicans23" }, { "opponent": "New York Knicks", "wins": 55, "losses": 69, "opponentWins": "knicks55" }, { "opponent": "Oklahoma City Thunder", "wins": 74, "losses": 131, "opponentWins": "thunder74" }, { "opponent": "Orlando Magic", "wins": 24, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "magic24" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia 76ers", "wins": 57, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "seventySixers57" }, { "opponent": "Phoenix Suns", "wins": 79, "losses": 130, "opponentWins": "suns79" }, { "opponent": "Portland Trail Blazers", "wins": 75, "losses": 141, "opponentWins": "trailblazers75" }, { "opponent": "Sacramento Kings", "wins": 87, "losses": 113, "opponentWins": "sKings87" }, { "opponent": "San Antonio Spurs", "wins": 37, "losses": 123, "opponentWins": "spurs37" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Raptors", "wins": 17, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "raptors17" }, { "opponent": "Utah Jazz", "wins": 75, "losses": 99, "opponentWins": "jass75" }, { "opponent": "Washington Wizards", "wins": 41, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "wizards41" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers are rival teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The two Pacific Division teams both play their home games at Staples Center in Los Angeles, inspiring their matchups to sometimes be called the "Hallway Series". The Lakers relocated from Minneapolis in 1960, while the Clippers moved from San Diego in 1984. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. The Lakers have won 11 of their 16 NBA championships since moving to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Clippers have made the playoffs only eight times since 1984 and were long considered the laughingstock of the NBA; in the history of the franchise, they have never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Some contended that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful. For the first time in 20 years, the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers in 2012–13. This was the first of four straight season series victories for the Clippers, which included season sweeps in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Lakers hold a 98–44 advantage in the all-time series against the Clippers.[a] The two teams have never met in the playoffs."},{"team":"Pittsburgh Penguins","teamLocation":"Pittsburgh","teamName":"Penguins","teamAbb":"PIT","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"115.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Detroit Red Wings","opponent":"redWings","opponentWins":"redWings65","league":"NHL","wins":"68","oWins":"65","ties":"16","oTies":"16","losses":"62","oLosses":"64","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"4","for":"523","oFor":"504","against":"504","oAgainst":"523","gamesPlayed":"149","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Pittsburgh, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"40.44","lng":"-79.99","illX":"970.31","illY":"937.58","cBack":"#C5B358","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"penguins","bothTeamsBackwards":"redWings-penguins","bothTeams":"penguins-redWings","id":"penguins68","extraClass":"pens pittsburgh-pens","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens","class":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens penguins-redWings","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 19, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "ducks19" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 67, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "bruins67" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 83, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sabres83" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 67, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "hurricanes67" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 17, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "blueJackets17" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 44, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blackhawks44" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 35, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "barons35" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 67, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "dStars67" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 68, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "redWings68" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 63, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "laKings63" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wild8" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 62, "losses": 112, "opponentWins": "canadiens62" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 98, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "devils98" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 116, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "islanders116" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 120, "losses": 115, "opponentWins": "nyRangers120" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 97, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "flyers97" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 42, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "coyotes42" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 16, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks16" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 52, "losses": 66, "opponentWins": "blues52" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 83, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs83" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 63, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks63" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 43, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets43" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 105, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "capitals105" } ],"rivalryNotes":"A much more recent rivalry, these two teams met in back-to-back Stanley Cup Finals in 2008 and 2009.

From 1996–2002, the teams met in five playoff series, three times in the Western Conference Finals. Out of those seven seasons, the teams combined to win five Stanley Cups and four Presidents' Trophies. From 1995–2003, both teams, along with the Devils, reigned exclusively as Stanley Cup champions, except in 1999, which was won by the Dallas Stars (the Devils beat the Red Wings in 1995, the Avalanche beat the Devils in 2001). The rivalry died down after the 2001–02 season, with the following season having both teams falling in round one and Roy's eventual retirement. The next confrontation between the two teams was in 2008, with the Red Wings sweeping the Avalanche 4–0 on the way to the Stanley Cup. A stadium series game took place on February 27, 2016 between the two teams at Coors Field. The Red Wings won the game 5–3."},{"team":"Anaheim Ducks","teamLocation":"Anaheim","teamName":"Ducks","teamAbb":"ANA","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"123.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Freeway Faceoff","opponentTeam":"Los Angeles Kings","opponent":"laKings","opponentWins":"laKings43","league":"NHL","wins":"61","oWins":"57","ties":"11","oTies":"11","losses":"44","oLosses":"48","otLosses":"13","oOtLosses":"13","for":"376","oFor":"353","against":"353","oAgainst":"376","gamesPlayed":"129","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Anaheim, CA","stateAbb":"CA","state":"California","country":"United States","lat":"33.81","lng":"-117.88","illX":"233.61","illY":"1048.61","cBack":"#000000","cOutline":"#F57D31","cText":"#B6985A","teamSmall":"ducks","bothTeamsBackwards":"laKings-ducks","bothTeams":"ducks-laKings","id":"ducks61","extraClass":"mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  anaheim-ducks ana anaheim ducks ca california united-states mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks","class":"nhl ice hockey  anaheim-ducks ana anaheim ducks ca california united-states mighty-ducks-of-anaheim mighty-ducks ducks-laKings","info":[ { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 15, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bruins15" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 13, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "sabres13" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 18, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "hurricanes18" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 26, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "blueJackets26" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 53, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames53" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "blackhawks45" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 43, "losses": 63, "opponentWins": "dStars43" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 25, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "redWings25" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 54, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers54" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 13, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "panthers13" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 61, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "laKings61" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 29, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "wild29" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 14, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "canadiens14" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 14, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "devils14" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 37, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "predators37" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 12, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "islanders12" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "nyRangers16" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators16" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 16, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "flyers16" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 68, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "coyotes68" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 11, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "penguins11" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 59, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "sharks59" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 39, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "blues39" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 15, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "lightning15" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 10, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs10" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 44, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks44" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 14, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets14" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 15, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "capitals15" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Freeway Face-Off is a series of ice hockey games played between the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings.

The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators' first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators' highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL's worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.<BR><BR>The Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators' Eric Gryba laid out Montreal's Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators' coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens' coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a "lack of respect." Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn't care what that "bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say." In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal's dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.<BR><BR>Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa."},{"team":"New York Jets","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Jets","teamAbb":"NYJ","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"133.00","rivalryType":"divisional","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New England Patriots","opponent":"patriots","opponentWins":"patriots59","league":"NFL","wins":"53","oWins":"58","ties":"1","oTies":"1","losses":"58","oLosses":"53","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"2367","oFor":"2538","against":"2538","oAgainst":"2367","gamesPlayed":"112","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.81","lng":"-74.07","illX":"1161.30","illY":"928.92","cBack":"#0C371D","cOutline":"#FFFFFF","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"nyJets","bothTeamsBackwards":"patriots-nyJets","bothTeams":"nyJets-patriots","id":"nyJets53","extraClass":"ny-jets ny","oldClass":"nfl american football  new-york-jets nyj new york jets ny new york united-states ny-jets ny","class":"nfl american football  new-york-jets nyj new york jets ny new york united-states ny-jets ny nyJets-patriots","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "aCardinals6" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 5, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "falcons5" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 52, "losses": 59, "opponentWins": "bills52" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 3, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers3" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 3, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "bears3" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 15, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bengals15" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 11, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "browns11" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "cowboys4" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 15, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "broncos15" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "lions6" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 8, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "packers8" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 5, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "texans5" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 28, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "colts28" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 5, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "jaguars5" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 17, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "chiefs17" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 4, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "rams4" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 53, "losses": 47, "opponentWins": "dolphins53" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 8, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "vikings8" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 53, "losses": 58, "opponentWins": "patriots53" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 6, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "saints6" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "nyGiants5" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 17, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "raiders17" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 0, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "eagles0" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 5, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "steelers5" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 12, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "chargers12" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 2, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners2" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "seahawks8" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 10, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "buccaneers10" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 19, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "titans19" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 3, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "redskins3" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Jets–Patriots rivalry is a rivalry between the New York Jets and New England Patriots of the National Football League.

The series name comes from the trophy the teams play for, which was first introduced in 1989 for an annual pre-season exhibition game between the two teams, and later reintroduced in 2008. The cup is awarded to the team that wins the most games against the other in a particular season. In the event of a tie, the team holding the trophy from the previous season retains it.<BR><BR>Prior to the introduction of interleague play, the Reds and Indians had only met in spring training or other exhibition games. Because the two teams play in opposite leagues, the only chance they can meet in the postseason is in the World Series. The Ohio Cup series was originally created in 1989 and was an exhibition game between the two teams played in the state capital of Columbus at Cooper Stadium just prior to the start of the season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, from 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six. The games in Columbus were typically well-attended, with attendance topping the stadium's 15,000-seat capacity in all but one year.<BR><BR>The regular-season series began in 1997 with the start of interleague play and has been played every season since except 2002. From 1999–2001 and every season since 2004, the teams meet in two three-game series per season, one in Cincinnati and one in Cleveland. For the 2013, 2014, and 2016 seasons, two two-game series were played back-to-back at each team's home field.

The Marlins broke into the league in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, while the Rays had their first season in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first meeting between the two teams took place on June 22, 1998 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida during the Rays' inaugural season. Beginning with the 2012 season, when the Marlins are the home team, games are played at Marlins Park. From 1998 to 2011, the games were played at Hard Rock Stadium (as it is currently named), though it has been known by several names in its existence.<BR><BR>Currently, because the Marlins play in the National League, and the Rays in the American League, the only possible postseason matchup the teams can have is in the World Series, though this has never happened as the two teams have yet to appear in the same postseason. Both teams have had appearances in the Fall Classic, however.

The two teams have combined for six Super Bowl victories (four by the Patriots) and eight AFC Championships since 2001, while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<BR><BR>The nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were AFC East division rivals from 1970–2001 (dating prior to the Colts' move from Baltimore to Indianapolis), their intensified enmity wasn't prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed AFC South following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment. Following New England's 43–22 win in the 2013–14 playoffs the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411–351.<BR><BR>The modern matchup spanning the period of 1998–2011 was usually headlined as a contest between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003–10; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter Drew Bledsoe, and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a 2004 AFC Divisional playoff game. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007–14. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie Andrew Luck."},{"team":"Miami Marlins","teamLocation":"Miami","teamName":"Marlins","teamAbb":"MIA","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"139.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Citrus Series","opponentTeam":"Tampa Bay Rays","opponent":"rays","opponentWins":"rays52","league":"MLB","wins":"51","oWins":"52","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"52","oLosses":"51","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"473","oFor":"481","against":"481","oAgainst":"473","gamesPlayed":"103","leagueLower":"mlb","sport":"Baseball","colour":"#ff6633","city":"Miami, FL","stateAbb":"FL","state":"Florida","country":"United States","lat":"25.78","lng":"-80.22","illX":"1315.84","illY":"1448.27","cBack":"#000000","cOutline":"#FCDE04","cText":"#0482CC","teamSmall":"marlins","bothTeamsBackwards":"rays-marlins","bothTeams":"marlins-rays","id":"marlins51","extraClass":"florida-marlins","oldClass":"mlb baseball  miami-marlins mia miami marlins fl florida united-states florida-marlins","class":"mlb baseball  miami-marlins mia miami marlins fl florida united-states florida-marlins marlins-rays","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Diamondbacks", "wins": 59, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "diamondbacks59" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Braves", "wins": 166, "losses": 229, "opponentWins": "braves166" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Orioles", "wins": 20, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "orioles20" }, { "opponent": "Boston Red Sox", "wins": 12, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "redSox12" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Cubs", "wins": 92, "losses": 93, "opponentWins": "cubs92" }, { "opponent": "Chicago White Sox", "wins": 6, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "whiteSox6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 81, "losses": 107, "opponentWins": "reds81" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Indians", "wins": 9, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "indians9" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Rockies", "wins": 101, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "rockies101" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Tigers", "wins": 8, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "tigers8" }, { "opponent": "Houston Astros", "wins": 78, "losses": 79, "opponentWins": "astros78" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Royals", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "royals7" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim", "wins": 4, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "angels4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Dodgers", "wins": 85, "losses": 97, "opponentWins": "dodgers85" }, { "opponent": "Milwaukee Brewers", "wins": 67, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "brewers67" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Twins", "wins": 6, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "twins6" }, { "opponent": "New York Mets", "wins": 187, "losses": 208, "opponentWins": "mets187" }, { "opponent": "New York Yankees", "wins": 11, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "yankees11" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Athletics", "wins": 5, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "athletics5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Phillies", "wins": 179, "losses": 218, "opponentWins": "phillies179" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 86, "losses": 96, "opponentWins": "pirates86" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Padres", "wins": 84, "losses": 94, "opponentWins": "padres84" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco Giants", "wins": 76, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "sfGiants76" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Mariners", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "mariners7" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Cardinals", "wins": 73, "losses": 106, "opponentWins": "cardinals73" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Rays", "wins": 51, "losses": 52, "opponentWins": "rays51" }, { "opponent": "Texas Rangers", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "tRangers8" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Blue Jays", "wins": 18, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJays18" }, { "opponent": "Washington Nationals", "wins": 207, "losses": 185, "opponentWins": "nationals207" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Citrus Series is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball.

The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the "traditional" Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.<BR><BR>The series was rarely noted by the national media during the teams' first decades of existence, probably due to both teams' long stretches of futility. However, the September 2006 match-up, which served as the Louisiana Superdome's official reopening after Hurricane Katrina, was heralded as a major milestone in New Orleans' and the Gulf Coast's recovery from the effects of the storm as well as the Saints' return to the city after their own year-long exile after the storm; the Saints later erected a statue outside the Superdome to commemorate their win in that game.<BR><BR>The late season match-ups in the 2010 and 2011 seasons held playoff implications for both teams. Games between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years; fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent. ESPN.com writer Len Pasquarelli has cited the rivalry as one of the best in sports: "Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities. Unless you've attended a Falcons-Saints debauchery-filled afternoon, you'll just have to take my word for how much fun it really can be."<BR><BR>Atlanta currently leads the all-time series 49-45 (48-45 regular season, 1-0 playoffs).

Once the Nordiques moved to Denver, the small rivalry still existed. Also, in a regular season game between Detroit and Montreal, the Wings scored on Patrick Roy nine times, leading to Roy demanding a trade. Roy was eventually traded to Colorado and became a huge factor in the rivalry.<BR><BR>The rivalry was largely predicated on the competitiveness of both teams in the late '90s and early 2000s. From 1996–2002, the teams met in five playoff series, three times in the Western Conference Finals. Out of those seven seasons, the teams combined to win five Stanley Cups and four Presidents' Trophies. From 1995–2003, both teams, along with the Devils, reigned exclusively as Stanley Cup champions, except in 1999, which was won by the Dallas Stars (the Devils beat the Red Wings in 1995, the Avalanche beat the Devils in 2001). The rivalry died down after the 2001–02 season, with the following season having both teams falling in round one and Roy's eventual retirement.

The first National Hockey League game was between the original Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens on December 19, 1917. Also, in 1927, the two teams faced each other in the second round, Ottawa won that series and they went on to win the Stanley Cup. These two teams face each other often as they are both in the Atlantic Division and there is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa. The modern Ottawa Senators' first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992 where the expansion Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3. That victory would be one of the only Senators' highlights of their inaugural season; they would win only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with ten wins and 24 points (tied for the NHL's worst record with the San Jose Sharks), while the Canadiens went on to win their 24th Stanley Cup that season.<BR><BR>The Senators and the Canadiens faced each other in the playoffs for the first time in 2013. In that series, there were a large amount of controversial events. In game 1, Senators' Eric Gryba laid out Montreal's Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, Senators' coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens' coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what Maclean said was a "lack of respect." Ottawa won that game 5-3. Plus, Brandon Prust also insulted Paul MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn't care what that "bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say." In Game 3, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the 3rd period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal's dirty play in that game. The underdog Senators eventually won the series 4–1.<BR><BR>Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later kicked out of the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserves a suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa."},{"team":"Philadelphia Eagles","teamLocation":"Philadelphia","teamName":"Eagles","teamAbb":"PHI","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"150.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Pittsburgh Steelers","opponent":"steelers","opponentWins":"steelers28","league":"NFL","wins":"47","oWins":"28","ties":"3","oTies":"3","losses":"28","oLosses":"47","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"1477","oFor":"1116","against":"1116","oAgainst":"1477","gamesPlayed":"78","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Philadelphia, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"39.90","lng":"-75.17","illX":"1030.99","illY":"988.88","cBack":"#003B48","cOutline":"#C0C0C0","cText":"#708090","teamSmall":"eagles","bothTeamsBackwards":"steelers-eagles","bothTeams":"eagles-steelers","id":"eagles47","extraClass":"philly","oldClass":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly","class":"nfl american football  philadelphia-eagles phi philadelphia eagles pa pennsylvania united-states philly eagles-steelers","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 55, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "aCardinals55" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 16, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "falcons16" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 7, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "bills7" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 6, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "cPanthers6" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 11, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "bears11" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 3, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "bengals3" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 17, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "browns17" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 49, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "cowboys49" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "broncos7" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 16, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "lions16" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 14, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "packers14" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 4, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans4" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 8, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "colts8" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "jaguars2" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 4, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "chiefs4" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 19, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "rams19" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 6, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "dolphins6" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 10, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "vikings10" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "patriots7" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 16, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "saints16" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 79, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "nyGiants79" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 10, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyJets10" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 6, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "raiders6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 47, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "steelers47" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 4, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "chargers4" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 12, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners12" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 7, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks7" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "buccaneers8" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "titans7" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 74, "losses": 84, "opponentWins": "redskins74" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Colts", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "bColts1" }, { "opponent": "Boston Yanks", "wins": 7, "losses": 2, "opponentWins": "yanks7" }, { "opponent": "Brooklyn Tigers", "wins": 6, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "bTigers6" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Reds", "wins": 3, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "reds3" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Texans", "wins": 1, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "texans1" }, { "opponent": "New York Yanks", "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "nyYanks2" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The two teams have met each other 78 times (including 1 postseason game), with the Philadelphia Eagles winning 47 games and the Pittsburgh Steelers winning 28 games.

The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the "traditional" Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.<BR><BR>The series was rarely noted by the national media during the teams' first decades of existence, probably due to both teams' long stretches of futility. However, the September 2006 match-up, which served as the Louisiana Superdome's official reopening after Hurricane Katrina, was heralded as a major milestone in New Orleans' and the Gulf Coast's recovery from the effects of the storm as well as the Saints' return to the city after their own year-long exile after the storm; the Saints later erected a statue outside the Superdome to commemorate their win in that game.<BR><BR>The late season match-ups in the 2010 and 2011 seasons held playoff implications for both teams. Games between the Falcons and Saints have riveted their respective regions for more than 40 years; fans of both teams consider the other their most important and hated opponent. ESPN.com writer Len Pasquarelli has cited the rivalry as one of the best in sports: "Every year, bus caravans loaded with rowdy (and usually very inebriated) fans make the seven-hour trip between the two cities. Unless you've attended a Falcons-Saints debauchery-filled afternoon, you'll just have to take my word for how much fun it really can be."<BR><BR>Atlanta currently leads the all-time series 49-45 (48-45 regular season, 1-0 playoffs).

The cup is awarded to the team that wins the most games against the other in a particular season. In the event of a tie, the team holding the trophy from the previous season retains it.<BR><BR>Prior to the introduction of interleague play, the Reds and Indians had only met in spring training or other exhibition games. Because the two teams play in opposite leagues, the only chance they can meet in the postseason is in the World Series. The Ohio Cup series was originally created in 1989 and was an exhibition game between the two teams played in the state capital of Columbus at Cooper Stadium just prior to the start of the season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, from 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six. The games in Columbus were typically well-attended, with attendance topping the stadium's 15,000-seat capacity in all but one year.<BR><BR>The regular-season series began in 1997 with the start of interleague play and has been played every season since except 2002.

For the 2013, 2014, and 2016 seasons, two two-game series were played back-to-back at each team's home field.

The two teams have combined for six Super Bowl victories (four by the Patriots) and eight AFC Championships since 2001, while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<BR><BR>The nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were AFC East division rivals from 1970–2001 (dating prior to the Colts' move from Baltimore to Indianapolis), their intensified enmity wasn't prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed AFC South following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment. Following New England's 43–22 win in the 2013–14 playoffs the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411–351.<BR><BR>The modern matchup spanning the period of 1998–2011 was usually headlined as a contest between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003–10; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter Drew Bledsoe, and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a 2004 AFC Divisional playoff game. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007–14. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie Andrew Luck."},{"team":"Minnesota Wild","teamLocation":"Minnesota","teamName":"Wild","teamAbb":"MIN","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"168.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks24","league":"NHL","wins":"37","oWins":"24","ties":"1","oTies":"1","losses":"22","oLosses":"28","otLosses":"2","oOtLosses":"9","for":"176","oFor":"158","against":"158","oAgainst":"176","gamesPlayed":"62","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"St Paul, MN","stateAbb":"MN","state":"Minnesota","country":"United States","lat":"44.94","lng":"-93.10","illX":"184.35","illY":"394.41","cBack":"#004F30","cOutline":"#EEE3C7","cText":"#C51230","teamSmall":"wild","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-wild","bothTeams":"wild-blackhawks","id":"wild37","extraClass":"","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-wild min minnesota wild mn minnesota united-states","class":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-wild min minnesota wild mn minnesota united-states wild-blackhawks","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 25, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "ducks25" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 14, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bruins14" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 11, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "sabres11" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 10, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "hurricanes10" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 25, "losses": 19, "opponentWins": "blueJackets25" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 36, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "flames36" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 37, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "blackhawks37" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 45, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "avalanche45" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 24, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "dStars24" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 16, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "redWings16" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 48, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "oilers48" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 13, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "panthers13" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 27, "losses": 18, "opponentWins": "laKings27" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 8, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "canadiens8" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "devils5" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 27, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "predators27" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 11, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "islanders11" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 7, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "nyRangers7" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 5, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators5" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 6, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "flyers6" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 28, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "coyotes28" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 12, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "penguins12" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 22, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "sharks22" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 27, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "blues27" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 12, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "lightning12" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 10, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs10" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 36, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "canucks36" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 15, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "wJets15" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 9, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "capitals9" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Blackhawks–Wild rivalry started during the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs when the two teams met in the first round.

The rivalry became even more intense with another playoff meeting between the Blackhawks and the Wild in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, this time in the second round. The Blackhawks would once again turn out victorious, this time winning in six games. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Blackhawks and the Wild met again in the second round. The Blackhawks would win yet again, but this time, in the fashion of a sweep. The rivalry has sparked interest within the NHL, and during the 2015 All Star Weekend in Columbus, the League announced two NHL Stadium Series games and the 2016 NHL Winter Classic.

Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns QB Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21. Interestingly, the Broncos would not go on to win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they beat the Browns."},{"team":"Pittsburgh Penguins","teamLocation":"Pittsburgh","teamName":"Penguins","teamAbb":"PIT","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"179.00","rivalryType":"manufactured","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Columbus Blue Jackets","opponent":"blueJackets","opponentWins":"blueJackets7","league":"NHL","wins":"17","oWins":"10","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"7","oLosses":"14","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"3","for":"88","oFor":"73","against":"73","oAgainst":"88","gamesPlayed":"27","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Pittsburgh, PA","stateAbb":"PA","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","lat":"40.44","lng":"-79.99","illX":"970.31","illY":"937.58","cBack":"#C5B358","cOutline":"#000000","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"penguins","bothTeamsBackwards":"blueJackets-penguins","bothTeams":"penguins-blueJackets","id":"penguins17","extraClass":"pens pittsburgh-pens","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens","class":"nhl ice hockey  pittsburgh-penguins pit   pa pennsylvania united-states pens pittsburgh-pens penguins-blueJackets","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 19, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "ducks19" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 67, "losses": 105, "opponentWins": "bruins67" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 83, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "sabres83" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 67, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "hurricanes67" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 17, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "blueJackets17" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 44, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blackhawks44" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 35, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "barons35" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 67, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "dStars67" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 68, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "redWings68" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 47, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "panthers47" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 63, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "laKings63" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 8, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wild8" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 62, "losses": 112, "opponentWins": "canadiens62" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 98, "losses": 103, "opponentWins": "devils98" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 116, "losses": 98, "opponentWins": "islanders116" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 120, "losses": 115, "opponentWins": "nyRangers120" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 52, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "senators52" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 97, "losses": 144, "opponentWins": "flyers97" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 42, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "coyotes42" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 16, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "sharks16" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 52, "losses": 66, "opponentWins": "blues52" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 45, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "lightning45" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 83, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs83" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 63, "losses": 37, "opponentWins": "canucks63" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 43, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "wJets43" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 105, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "capitals105" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Columbus Blue Jackets have established a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Penguins in recent history (as of the 2013–14 season). This is referenced in telecasts, news articles  and online arguments between fans of the clubs. This rivalry is one of the NHL's newest, and primarily exists due to divisional and geographical alignments (Columbus and Pittsburgh are approximately 3 hours apart by automobile, via Interstate 70). As a result, it is not uncommon to see large numbers of visiting Penguins fans at games versus the Jackets in Nationwide Arena. Pittsburgh holds a 16–7–0 all-time regular season record, a 4–2 all-time playoff record, and a series victory in the lone playoff series to date between the two teams.<BR><BR>The seeds for this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, the latter of whom has a personal feud with Penguins' star centerman Sidney Crosby. The 2013–14 NHL realignment saw the Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against the Jackets, but Columbus, on the heels of a 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games.<BR><BR>Despite this series victory however, the Blue Jackets have gotten the better of the Penguins from that point on, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus over the past two years of play. Further intensifying the rivalry, the Jackets fired head coach Todd Richards early in the 2015–16 season, replacing him with John Tortorella, who has a long-standing disdain for the Penguins, dating back to his days as head coach of the New York Rangers.<BR><BR>Tensions between the teams further flared up during a regular season game at Nationwide Arena on November 27, 2015, when Brandon Dubinsky was penalized for a cross-check to Sidney Crosby, a hit which briefly injured Crosby and later earned Dubinsky a one-game suspension. Crosby would later return to the game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2-1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky's suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: "We're not going to whine here. Pittsburgh can whine. Pittsburgh whines enough for the whole league, so there's no room for any other team to whine.

A team from Edmonton named the Eskimos joined the WIFU for the 1938 and 1939 seasons, but withdrew from competition in 1940. While an Edmonton team may have made the first appearance in the Grey Cup in 1921 (and lost), the newly named Stampeders made their first appearance and won in that same game in the 36th Grey Cup in 1948.<BR><BR>The next season, in 1949, the current incarnation of the Edmonton Eskimos was founded and immediately joined the WIFU – this time, for good. The first game between the current Stampeders and Eskimos franchises was the first game in Eskimos history as the defending Grey Cup Stampeders defeated the Eskimos 20–6 on Labour Day. Since 1949, the Eskimos and Stampeders have played on Labour Day every year with the exception of eleven of those seasons, with the most recent being the 1981 season. This has been one of the Canadian Football League's marquee match-ups as the Labour Day Classic in Calgary was followed by the Friday night rematch in Edmonton, resulting in a quick turnaround for both teams. Starting in 2014, the rematch game has been played on the following Saturday. As of the 2016 CFL season, the all-time record favours Edmonton, as the Eskimos have a record of 125–95–3 against their provincial rivals.<BR><BR>In terms of the post-season, the two teams have played each other 26 times, with Edmonton holding a slight edge with 14 victories. The two teams also frequently meet in the West Final. Between 1990 and 2003, the two teams clashed nine times to decide who would represent the West in the Grey Cup, and at least one Alberta team was in the game each year. Edmonton has won three out of the last eight playoff match-ups, the most recent one in the 2015 West Final. Edmonton has also won the most recent championship by an Albertan team, in 2015 with the 103rd Grey Cup game. While the Stampeders may have won the Grey Cup first, the Eskimos have won the most recent and the most, with 14 titles compared to the Stampeders' seven as of 2015.<BR><BR>Currently, the Calgary and Edmonton franchises play each other two to three times during the regular season and have played each other at least three times in every regular season but 2004 between 1996 and 2016. The Stampeders have qualified for the playoffs in every season since 2005, while the Eskimos have missed the playoffs four times in that same time frame.

The rivalry reached its peak from 2001 to 2005, during which time the Earthquakes and the Galaxy combined to win four MLS Cup titles in a five-year period. The term "Clásico" is commonly used to refer to other rivalries in Spanish-speaking countries, most prominently, the Spanish Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid, or the Argentine Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate. Los Angeles and San Jose is considered to be one of the most historical rivalries in American soccer. British daily newspaper, The Guardian rates "the California Clásico is perhaps the most historic and intense rivalry the league has." Todd Dunivant, retired U.S. national team and MLS player, when asked about the rivalry stated "I think it's the best rivalry in MLS, I think it's got the most history, it's got the most meaningful big games". The rivalry originated from the historical Northern California vs. Southern California sporting and cultural rivalries, as well as from the relative proximity of the cities, which are about 360 miles (580 km) apart, which allows rival fans to attend each other's games. They are sometimes identified with opposing political positions, with Los Angeles (Southern California) viewed as representing conservatism and San Jose (Northern California) viewed as representing liberalism. SB Nation claims that the California Clásico could become the most important rivalry in MLS."},{"team":"Calgary Stampeders","teamLocation":"Calgary","teamName":"Stampeders","teamAbb":"CGY","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"189.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Battle of Alberta","opponentTeam":"Edmonton Eskimos","opponent":"eskimos","opponentWins":"eskimos14","league":"CFL","wins":"95","oWins":"125","ties":"3","oTies":"3","losses":"125","oLosses":"95","otLosses":"3","oOtLosses":"3","for":"4809","oFor":"5205","against":"5205","oAgainst":"4809","gamesPlayed":"223","leagueLower":"cfl","sport":"Canadian Football","colour":"#61b8da","city":"Calgary, AB","stateAbb":"AB","state":"Alberta","country":"Canada","lat":"51.07","lng":"-114.12","illX":"207.22","illY":"119.23","cBack":"#c8102E","cOutline":"#010101","cText":"#ffffff","teamSmall":"stampeders","bothTeamsBackwards":"eskimos-stampeders","bothTeams":"stampeders-eskimos","id":"stampeders95","extraClass":"stamps calgary-stamps","oldClass":"cfl canadian football  calgary-stampeders cgy calgary stampeders ab alberta canada stamps calgary-stamps","class":"cfl canadian football  calgary-stampeders cgy calgary stampeders ab alberta canada stamps calgary-stamps stampeders-eskimos","info":[ { "opponent": "BC (Since 1954)", "wins": 103, "losses": 81, "opponentWins": "bcLions103" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton (Since 1949)", "wins": 95, "losses": 125, "opponentWins": "eskimos95" }, { "opponent": "Hamilton (Since 1909)", "wins": 61, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "tigerCats61" }, { "opponent": "Montreal (Since 1946)", "wins": 38, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "allouettes38" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa (Since 1909)", "wins": 40, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "redblacks40" }, { "opponent": "Saskatchewan (Since 1910)", "wins": 127, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "roughriders127" }, { "opponent": "Toronto (Since 1909)", "wins": 48, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "argonauts48" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg (Since 1913)", "wins": 109, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "other109" }, { "opponent": "USA", "wins": 14, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "usa14" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The current incarnation of the Calgary Stampeders was first established as the Calgary Bronks in 1935 and captured the last ARFU title before the league was amalgamated to form the Western Interprovincial Football Union with the Regina Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers. A team from Edmonton named the Eskimos joined the WIFU for the 1938 and 1939 seasons, but withdrew from competition in 1940. While an Edmonton team may have made the first appearance in the Grey Cup in 1921 (and lost), the newly named Stampeders made their first appearance and won in that same game in the 36th Grey Cup in 1948.<BR><BR>The next season, in 1949, the current incarnation of the Edmonton Eskimos was founded and immediately joined the WIFU – this time, for good. The first game between the current Stampeders and Eskimos franchises was the first game in Eskimos history as the defending Grey Cup Stampeders defeated the Eskimos 20–6 on Labour Day. Since 1949, the Eskimos and Stampeders have played on Labour Day every year with the exception of eleven of those seasons, with the most recent being the 1981 season. This has been one of the Canadian Football League's marquee match-ups as the Labour Day Classic in Calgary was followed by the Friday night rematch in Edmonton, resulting in a quick turnaround for both teams. Starting in 2014, the rematch game has been played on the following Saturday. As of the 2016 CFL season, the all-time record favours Edmonton, as the Eskimos have a record of 125–95–3 against their provincial rivals.<BR><BR>In terms of the post-season, the two teams have played each other 26 times, with Edmonton holding a slight edge with 14 victories. The two teams also frequently meet in the West Final. Between 1990 and 2003, the two teams clashed nine times to decide who would represent the West in the Grey Cup, and at least one Alberta team was in the game each year. Edmonton has won three out of the last eight playoff match-ups, the most recent one in the 2015 West Final. Edmonton has also won the most recent championship by an Albertan team, in 2015 with the 103rd Grey Cup game. While the Stampeders may have won the Grey Cup first, the Eskimos have won the most recent and the most, with 14 titles compared to the Stampeders' seven as of 2015.<BR><BR>Currently, the Calgary and Edmonton franchises play each other two to three times during the regular season and have played each other at least three times in every regular season but 2004 between 1996 and 2016. The Stampeders have qualified for the playoffs in every season since 2005, while the Eskimos have missed the playoffs four times in that same time frame. Both teams have enjoyed much success in their histories as both franchises have never missed the playoffs at the same time. The Eskimos have made the playoffs in all but six years since 1966, including 34 years in a row from 1972 to 2005 – a streak unmatched in North American major league sports.

This is referenced in telecasts, news articles  and online arguments between fans of the clubs. This rivalry is one of the NHL's newest, and primarily exists due to divisional and geographical alignments (Columbus and Pittsburgh are approximately 3 hours apart by automobile, via Interstate 70). As a result, it is not uncommon to see large numbers of visiting Penguins fans at games versus the Jackets in Nationwide Arena. Pittsburgh holds a 16–7–0 all-time regular season record, a 4–2 all-time playoff record, and a series victory in the lone playoff series to date between the two teams.<BR><BR>The seeds for this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, the latter of whom has a personal feud with Penguins' star centerman Sidney Crosby. The 2013–14 NHL realignment saw the Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against the Jackets, but Columbus, on the heels of a 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games.<BR><BR>Despite this series victory however, the Blue Jackets have gotten the better of the Penguins from that point on, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus over the past two years of play. Further intensifying the rivalry, the Jackets fired head coach Todd Richards early in the 2015–16 season, replacing him with John Tortorella, who has a long-standing disdain for the Penguins, dating back to his days as head coach of the New York Rangers.<BR><BR>Tensions between the teams further flared up during a regular season game at Nationwide Arena on November 27, 2015, when Brandon Dubinsky was penalized for a cross-check to Sidney Crosby, a hit which briefly injured Crosby and later earned Dubinsky a one-game suspension. Crosby would later return to the game; however, the Jackets prevailed 2-1 in overtime over the Penguins, a goal on which Dubinsky assisted. In an interview following Dubinsky's suspension, Tortorella would later go on to be quoted: "We're not going to whine here. Pittsburgh can whine. Pittsburgh whines enough for the whole league, so there's no room for any other team to whine. We'll just go about our business.""},{"team":"Vancouver Whitecaps FC","teamLocation":"Vancouver","teamName":"Whitecaps FC","teamAbb":"VAN","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"197.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"Cascadia Cup","opponentTeam":"Portland Timbers","opponent":"timbers","opponentWins":"timbers3","league":"MLS","wins":"6","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"","losses":"-","oLosses":"","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"","for":"-","oFor":"","against":"-","oAgainst":"","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"mls","sport":"Soccer","colour":"#993366","city":"Vancouver, BC","stateAbb":"BC","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada","lat":"49.28","lng":"-123.11","illX":"96.58","illY":"198.26","cBack":"#00245E","cOutline":"#9DC2EA","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"whitecaps","bothTeamsBackwards":"timbers-whitecaps","bothTeams":"whitecaps-timbers","id":"whitecaps6","extraClass":"caps van-city fc vancouver-caps","oldClass":"mls soccer  vancouver-whitecaps-fc van vancouver whitecaps fc bc british columbia canada caps van-city fc vancouver-caps","class":"mls soccer  vancouver-whitecaps-fc van vancouver whitecaps fc bc british columbia canada caps van-city fc vancouver-caps whitecaps-timbers","info":[{"opponent": "Live Data Unavailable", "wins": "", "losses": "", "opponentWins": ""}],"rivalryNotes":"The Cascadia Cup is the name of the trophy created in 2004 by supporters of the Portland Timbers, Seattle Sounders, and Vancouver Whitecaps, which is awarded each season to the best soccer team in the Pacific Northwest.

Todd Dunivant, retired U.S. national team and MLS player, when asked about the rivalry stated "I think it's the best rivalry in MLS, I think it's got the most history, it's got the most meaningful big games".

The series is named after the late Lamar Hunt, who was one of the league's early major investors and a key supporter of American soccer. Initially, the series was contested between the two teams still owned by the Hunt Sports Group (Sporting Kansas City was also previously owned by the Hunt Sports Group, but was sold before the Pioneer Cup began). However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group. The Pioneer Cup is the second event in American soccer named after Lamar Hunt, whose name is also given to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.<BR><BR>The first two editions of the Pioneer Cup were single preseason matches. The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season. The first leg was played at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, OH on April 1, 2011. The Crew took advantage of FC Dallas going one man down in the 33rd minute to win 2–0. The second and deciding leg was played at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, TX on July 2, 2011, with Dallas winning 2–0. Tied 2–2 on aggregate, Columbus regained the Pioneer Cup with the tie being broken by all-time head to head goals, 6-4 in favor of Columbus.<BR><BR>When Major League Soccer restructured scheduling ahead of the 2012 season, Columbus and Dallas would play only once in the regular season. Therefore, the Cup was changed to a one-game, winner-take-all contest. In the event of a draw, the all time head-to-head goals tiebreaker remained. In the 2013 edition, Columbus scored four goals with three different scorers to win the Cup for the second straight year. The 2014 contest was a bit more lackluster than previous encounters. An early summer thunderstorm suspended the start of the match and then eventually postponed it to the following day after a Columbus fan was struck by lightning and injured prior to the game being started. The game was played the next day on a hot afternoon, but no player from either side could find the net in a match then ended scoreless. Due to the scoreless draw, Columbus retained the Cup for the third year in a row due to the all-time head-to-head goals tiebreaker being 12-7 in Columbus' favor."},{"team":"Tampa Bay Buccaneers","teamLocation":"Tampa Bay","teamName":"Buccaneers","teamAbb":"TB","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"209.00","rivalryType":"geographic","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Miami Dolphins","opponent":"dolphins","opponentWins":"dolphins5","league":"NFL","wins":"5","oWins":"5","ties":"0","oTies":"0","losses":"5","oLosses":"5","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"228","oFor":"222","against":"222","oAgainst":"228","gamesPlayed":"10","leagueLower":"nfl","sport":"American Football","colour":"#333366","city":"Tampa, FL","stateAbb":"FL","state":"Florida","country":"United States","lat":"27.98","lng":"-82.50","illX":"1197.74","illY":"1406.51","cBack":"#D3A205","cOutline":"#D60A0B","cText":"#89765F","teamSmall":"buccaneers","bothTeamsBackwards":"dolphins-buccaneers","bothTeams":"buccaneers-dolphins","id":"buccaneers5","extraClass":"tampa tampa-bucs tampa-bucks tampa-bay-bucks tampa-buccaneers bucs bucks","oldClass":"nfl american football  tampa-bay-buccaneers tb tampa bay buccaneers fl florida united-states tampa tampa-bucs tampa-bucks tampa-bay-bucks tampa-buccaneers bucs bucks","class":"nfl american football  tampa-bay-buccaneers tb tampa bay buccaneers fl florida united-states tampa tampa-bucs tampa-bucks tampa-bay-bucks tampa-buccaneers bucs bucks buccaneers-dolphins","info":[ { "opponent": "Arizona Cardinals", "wins": 9, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "aCardinals9" }, { "opponent": "Atlanta Falcons", "wins": 24, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "falcons24" }, { "opponent": "Baltimore Ravens", "wins": 2, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "ravens2" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Bills", "wins": 7, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "bills7" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Panthers", "wins": 12, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "cPanthers12" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Bears", "wins": 19, "losses": 38, "opponentWins": "bears19" }, { "opponent": "Cincinnati Bengals", "wins": 7, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "bengals7" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Browns", "wins": 3, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "browns3" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Cowboys", "wins": 4, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "cowboys4" }, { "opponent": "Denver Broncos", "wins": 2, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "broncos2" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Lions", "wins": 26, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "lions26" }, { "opponent": "Green Bay Packers", "wins": 21, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "packers21" }, { "opponent": "Houston Texans", "wins": 1, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "texans1" }, { "opponent": "Indianapolis Colts", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "colts5" }, { "opponent": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "wins": 2, "losses": 4, "opponentWins": "jaguars2" }, { "opponent": "Kansas City Chiefs", "wins": 7, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "chiefs7" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Rams", "wins": 8, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "rams8" }, { "opponent": "Miami Dolphins", "wins": 5, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "dolphins5" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Vikings", "wins": 22, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "vikings22" }, { "opponent": "New England Patriots", "wins": 2, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "patriots2" }, { "opponent": "New Orleans Saints", "wins": 18, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "saints18" }, { "opponent": "New York Giants", "wins": 6, "losses": 13, "opponentWins": "nyGiants6" }, { "opponent": "New York Jets", "wins": 1, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "nyJets1" }, { "opponent": "Oakland Raiders", "wins": 2, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "raiders2" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Eagles", "wins": 6, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "eagles6" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Steelers", "wins": 2, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "steelers2" }, { "opponent": "San Diego Chargers", "wins": 3, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "chargers3" }, { "opponent": "San Francisco 49ers", "wins": 5, "losses": 17, "opponentWins": "fortyNiners5" }, { "opponent": "Seattle Seahawks", "wins": 5, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "seahawks5" }, { "opponent": "Tennessee Titans", "wins": 2, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "titans2" }, { "opponent": "Washington Redskins", "wins": 10, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "redskins10" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Buccaneers–Dolphins rivalry is between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Miami Dolphins of the National Football League.

Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns QB Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21.

The series is named after the late Lamar Hunt, who was one of the league's early major investors and a key supporter of American soccer. Initially, the series was contested between the two teams still owned by the Hunt Sports Group (Sporting Kansas City was also previously owned by the Hunt Sports Group, but was sold before the Pioneer Cup began). However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group. The Pioneer Cup is the second event in American soccer named after Lamar Hunt, whose name is also given to the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.<BR><BR>The first two editions of the Pioneer Cup were single preseason matches. The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season. The first leg was played at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, OH on April 1, 2011. The Crew took advantage of FC Dallas going one man down in the 33rd minute to win 2–0. The second and deciding leg was played at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, TX on July 2, 2011, with Dallas winning 2–0. Tied 2–2 on aggregate, Columbus regained the Pioneer Cup with the tie being broken by all-time head to head goals, 6-4 in favor of Columbus.<BR><BR>When Major League Soccer restructured scheduling ahead of the 2012 season, Columbus and Dallas would play only once in the regular season. Therefore, the Cup was changed to a one-game, winner-take-all contest. In the event of a draw, the all time head-to-head goals tiebreaker remained. In the 2013 edition, Columbus scored four goals with three different scorers to win the Cup for the second straight year. The 2014 contest was a bit more lackluster than previous encounters. An early summer thunderstorm suspended the start of the match and then eventually postponed it to the following day after a Columbus fan was struck by lightning and injured prior to the game being started.

The rivalry was considered as the only "true" local derby in MLS from 2005 until 2014, as both teams were based in the StubHub Center in the Greater Los Angeles city of Carson, California. The rivalry ended in 2014 when Chivas ceased operations.<BR><BR>The word "SuperClasico" is an allegory to the Mexican Súper Clásico between Club América and Chivas USA's parent club Chivas Guadalajara. The term "Clásico" is commonly used to refer to other rivalries in Spanish-speaking countries, most prominently, Argentina's Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate or Spain's El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The derby was sponsored by auto company Honda.<BR><BR>From 2005–2007, the derby was four league matches (with a Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match in 2005). In 2008–2009, the derby was played three times (plus a two-legged playoff series in 2009). For 2010-2011, the derby was played twice each season. All games were played at StubHub Center, the local venue for both teams. However, in 2012, the league reverted to a more American-style format that sacrificed equity for divisional rivalries which resulted in the teams facing each other 3 times again.

However, the Columbus Crew was sold in 2013, and thus FC Dallas remains the only MLS team still owned by the Hunt Sports Group.

The inaugural edition was played on March 11, 2007 at Pizza Hut Park (now known as Toyota Stadium), with Columbus defeating Dallas 3–0. Proceeds from the game went to the charity Dallas SCORES. The second edition of the Cup was played on March 20, 2010, at Pizza Hut Park with Dallas defeating Columbus 2–1 in heavy snow.<BR><BR>In 2011, the Pioneer Cup was changed to a two-game, aggregate-goal series played during the regular season.

There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), the tables were turned, thanks to an 18-year-old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding three games to one series lead, and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes."},{"team":"Winnipeg Jets","teamLocation":"Winnipeg","teamName":"Jets","teamAbb":"WIN WPG","teamNotes":"Original Franchise, now Arizona Coyotes","fixed":"TRUE","index":"228.00","rivalryType":"expansion","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Calgary Flames","opponent":"flames","opponentWins":"flames0","league":"NHL","wins":"79","oWins":"12","ties":"20","oTies":"1","losses":"86","oLosses":"9","otLosses":"4","oOtLosses":"0","for":"613","oFor":"70","against":"670","oAgainst":"59","gamesPlayed":"189","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Winnipeg, MB","stateAbb":"MB","state":"Manitoba","country":"Canada","lat":"49.89","lng":"-97.20","illX":"390.93","illY":"63.82","cBack":"#002D62","cOutline":"#006EC8","cText":"#C9C9C9","teamSmall":"wJets","bothTeamsBackwards":"flames-wJets","bothTeams":"wJets-flames","id":"wJets79","extraClass":"arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  winnipeg-jets win wpg   mb manitoba canada arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes","class":"nhl ice hockey  winnipeg-jets win wpg   mb manitoba canada arizona coyotes arizona-coyotes phoenix-coyotes wJets-flames","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 48, "losses": 58, "opponentWins": "ducks48" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 21, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "bruins21" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 23, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "sabres23" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 29, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "hurricanes29" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 28, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "blueJackets28" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 79, "losses": 86, "opponentWins": "flames79" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 56, "losses": 62, "opponentWins": "blackhawks56" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 52, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "avalanche52" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 71, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "dStars71" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 47, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "redWings47" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 80, "losses": 92, "opponentWins": "oilers80" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 16, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "panthers16" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 107, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "laKings107" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 25, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "wild25" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 16, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "canadiens16" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 38, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "devils38" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 30, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "predators30" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 26, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "islanders26" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 25, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "nyRangers25" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 15, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "senators15" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 30, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "flyers30" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 29, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "penguins29" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 60, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "sharks60" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 56, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "blues56" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 15, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "lightning15" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 51, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs51" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 71, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "canucks71" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 15, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wJets15" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 29, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "capitals29" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Flames and Jets (the original incarnation) met in the playoffs three straight years in the 1980s, with Winnipeg winning two of the three matchups.

The rivalry has also allegedly prevented Spurs coach Gregg Popovich from coaching the USA Basketball team in the 2008 Summer Olympics."},{"team":"Edmonton Oilers","teamLocation":"Edmonton","teamName":"Oilers","teamAbb":"EDM","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"232.00","rivalryType":"pre","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Winnipeg Jets","opponent":"wJets","opponentWins":"wJets0","league":"NHL","wins":"13","oWins":"80","ties":"1","oTies":"11","losses":"5","oLosses":"92","otLosses":"5","oOtLosses":"8","for":"80","oFor":"677","against":"59","oAgainst":"760","gamesPlayed":"24","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Edmonton, AB","stateAbb":"AB","state":"Alberta","country":"Canada","lat":"53.55","lng":"-113.50","illX":"57.57","illY":"125.00","cBack":"#013E7F","cOutline":"#EB6E1E","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"oilers","bothTeamsBackwards":"wJets-oilers","bothTeams":"oilers-wJets","id":"oilers13","extraClass":"oil","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  edmonton-oilers edm   ab alberta canada oil","class":"nhl ice hockey  edmonton-oilers edm   ab alberta canada oil oilers-wJets","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 42, "losses": 49, "opponentWins": "ducks42" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 20, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "bruins20" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 39, "losses": 22, "opponentWins": "sabres39" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 38, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "hurricanes38" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 31, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "blueJackets31" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 95, "losses": 109, "opponentWins": "flames95" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 54, "losses": 61, "opponentWins": "blackhawks54" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 74, "losses": 64, "opponentWins": "avalanche74" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 47, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "dStars47" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 49, "losses": 57, "opponentWins": "redWings49" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 15, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "panthers15" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 89, "losses": 78, "opponentWins": "laKings89" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 31, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "wild31" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 38, "losses": 36, "opponentWins": "canadiens38" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 35, "losses": 26, "opponentWins": "devils35" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 26, "losses": 31, "opponentWins": "predators26" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 30, "losses": 28, "opponentWins": "islanders30" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 32, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "nyRangers32" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 17, "losses": 14, "opponentWins": "senators17" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 31, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "flyers31" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 100, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "coyotes100" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 38, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "penguins38" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 48, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "sharks48" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 54, "losses": 60, "opponentWins": "blues54" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 18, "losses": 12, "opponentWins": "lightning18" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 43, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs43" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 116, "losses": 83, "opponentWins": "canucks116" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 13, "losses": 5, "opponentWins": "wJets13" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 30, "losses": 34, "opponentWins": "capitals30" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The Oilers and Jets both started their existence in the World Hockey Association in 1972. There, the Jets dominated the Oilers winning the Avco Cup three times, while the Oilers were not playoff contenders. But, when they joined the NHL in 1979 (along with the Quebec Nordiques and Hartford Whalers), the tables were turned, thanks to an 18-year-old from Brantford, Ontario named Wayne Gretzky. From 1983 to 1989, the Oilers and Jets met in the playoffs five times, the Oilers won every one of them, losing only one game out of the 19 games played between the two on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1988; with the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup in the latter four years. Gretzky had been traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the time the two teams met in the first round of the 1990 playoffs. The Jets took a commanding three games to one series lead, and led Game 5 by that same margin. Eventually, the Oilers fought back to win the next three games and the series in seven. The Oilers would lose just three more games the remainder of the playoffs, en route to their fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven years. The rivalry ended in 1996 when the original Jets left Winnipeg to become the Phoenix Coyotes."},{"team":"New York Rangers","teamLocation":"New York","teamName":"Rangers","teamAbb":"NYR","teamNotes":"","fixed":"TRUE","index":"233.00","rivalryType":"territorial","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"New York Americans","opponent":"americans","opponentWins":"americans0","league":"NHL","wins":"57","oWins":"23","ties":"14","oTies":"14","losses":"23","oLosses":"57","otLosses":"0","oOtLosses":"0","for":"295","oFor":"189","against":"189","oAgainst":"295","gamesPlayed":"94","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"New York City, NY","stateAbb":"NY","state":"New York","country":"United States","lat":"40.75","lng":"-73.99","illX":"1145.15","illY":"822.08","cBack":"#0161AB","cOutline":"#E51837","cText":"#FFFFFF","teamSmall":"nyRangers","bothTeamsBackwards":"americans-nyRangers","bothTeams":"nyRangers-americans","id":"nyRangers57","extraClass":"ny-rangers ny","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny","class":"nhl ice hockey  new-york-rangers nyr   ny new york united-states ny-rangers ny nyRangers-americans","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 14, "losses": 15, "opponentWins": "ducks14" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 254, "losses": 289, "opponentWins": "bruins254" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 70, "losses": 75, "opponentWins": "sabres70" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 75, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "hurricanes75" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 14, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "blueJackets14" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 44, "losses": 54, "opponentWins": "flames44" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 240, "losses": 245, "opponentWins": "blackhawks240" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 38, "losses": 10, "opponentWins": "barons38" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 37, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "avalanche37" }, { "opponent": "Dallas Stars", "wins": 73, "losses": 39, "opponentWins": "dStars73" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 217, "losses": 262, "opponentWins": "redWings217" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 31, "losses": 30, "opponentWins": "oilers31" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 50, "losses": 29, "opponentWins": "panthers50" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 67, "losses": 45, "opponentWins": "laKings67" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 13, "losses": 7, "opponentWins": "wild13" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 194, "losses": 328, "opponentWins": "canadiens194" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Maroons", "wins": 28, "losses": 21, "opponentWins": "maroons28" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 111, "losses": 89, "opponentWins": "devils111" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 11, "losses": 8, "opponentWins": "predators11" }, { "opponent": "New York Americans", "wins": 57, "losses": 23, "opponentWins": "americans57" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "islanders125" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 17, "losses": 6, "opponentWins": "senators17" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 39, "losses": 41, "opponentWins": "senators39" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 128, "losses": 113, "opponentWins": "flyers128" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Quakers", "wins": 6, "losses": 0, "opponentWins": "quakers6" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 44, "losses": 25, "opponentWins": "coyotes44" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 125, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "penguins125" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "wins": 18, "losses": 3, "opponentWins": "pirates18" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 24, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "sharks24" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Eagles", "wins": 5, "losses": 1, "opponentWins": "stlEagles5" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 79, "losses": 43, "opponentWins": "blues79" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 46, "losses": 35, "opponentWins": "lightning46" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 228, "losses": 275, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs228" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 78, "losses": 32, "opponentWins": "canucks78" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 28, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "wJets28" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 95, "losses": 91, "opponentWins": "capitals95" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The New York Americans and New York Rangers had a rivalry that existed between 1925 and 1942. The two teams played in Madison Square Garden however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born. The two teams first met in the playoffs via two-game total goals series in 1929. Both teams struggled to score in both games as goaltender Roy Worters of the Americans shut down the Rangers for the most part, and the Americans struggled to find offense during the games. The Rangers would win the series 1–0 in overtime.<BR><BR>The Americans then struggled to make the playoffs only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once America joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994, seven years after Dutton died in 1987."},{"team":"Minnesota North Stars","teamLocation":"Minnesota","teamName":"North Stars","teamAbb":"MIN","teamNotes":"Defunct, now Dallas Stars","fixed":"TRUE","index":"234.00","rivalryType":"","rivalryName":"","opponentTeam":"Chicago Blackhawks","opponent":"blackhawks","opponentWins":"blackhawks0","league":"NHL","wins":"0","oWins":"-","ties":"-","oTies":"-","losses":"-","oLosses":"-","otLosses":"-","oOtLosses":"-","for":"-","oFor":"-","against":"-","oAgainst":"-","gamesPlayed":"-","leagueLower":"nhl","sport":"Ice Hockey","colour":"#ff9966","city":"Bloomington, MN","stateAbb":"MN","state":"Minnesota","country":"United States","lat":"44.86","lng":"-93.24","illX":"222.78","illY":"288.01","cBack":"#008348","cOutline":"#fdb827","cText":"#000000","teamSmall":"northStars","bothTeamsBackwards":"blackhawks-northStars","bothTeams":"northStars-blackhawks","id":"northStars0","extraClass":"stars dallas dallas-stars","oldClass":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-north-stars min minnesota north stars mn minnesota united-states stars dallas dallas-stars","class":"nhl ice hockey  minnesota-north-stars min minnesota north stars mn minnesota united-states stars dallas dallas-stars northStars-blackhawks","info":[ { "opponent": "Anaheim Ducks", "wins": 69, "losses": 33, "opponentWins": "ducks69" }, { "opponent": "Boston Bruins", "wins": 33, "losses": 77, "opponentWins": "bruins33" }, { "opponent": "Buffalo Sabres", "wins": 46, "losses": 53, "opponentWins": "sabres46" }, { "opponent": "Carolina Hurricanes", "wins": 42, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "hurricanes42" }, { "opponent": "Columbus Blue Jackets", "wins": 33, "losses": 16, "opponentWins": "blueJackets33" }, { "opponent": "Calgary Flames", "wins": 67, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "flames67" }, { "opponent": "Chicago Blackhawks", "wins": 105, "losses": 126, "opponentWins": "blackhawks105" }, { "opponent": "Cleveland Barons", "wins": 29, "losses": 24, "opponentWins": "barons29" }, { "opponent": "Colorado Avalanche", "wins": 55, "losses": 56, "opponentWins": "avalanche55" }, { "opponent": "Detroit Red Wings", "wins": 104, "losses": 108, "opponentWins": "redWings104" }, { "opponent": "Edmonton Oilers", "wins": 69, "losses": 42, "opponentWins": "oilers69" }, { "opponent": "Florida Panthers", "wins": 14, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "panthers14" }, { "opponent": "Los Angeles Kings", "wins": 110, "losses": 76, "opponentWins": "laKings110" }, { "opponent": "Minnesota Wild", "wins": 38, "losses": 20, "opponentWins": "wild38" }, { "opponent": "Montreal Canadiens", "wins": 34, "losses": 73, "opponentWins": "canadiens34" }, { "opponent": "New Jersey Devils", "wins": 53, "losses": 40, "opponentWins": "devils53" }, { "opponent": "Nashville Predators", "wins": 42, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "predators42" }, { "opponent": "New York Islanders", "wins": 39, "losses": 51, "opponentWins": "islanders39" }, { "opponent": "New York Rangers", "wins": 41, "losses": 72, "opponentWins": "nyRangers41" }, { "opponent": "Ottawa Senators", "wins": 21, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "senators21" }, { "opponent": "Philadelphia Flyers", "wins": 42, "losses": 71, "opponentWins": "flyers42" }, { "opponent": "Arizona Coyotes", "wins": 86, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "coyotes86" }, { "opponent": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "wins": 62, "losses": 65, "opponentWins": "penguins62" }, { "opponent": "San Jose Sharks", "wins": 62, "losses": 44, "opponentWins": "sharks62" }, { "opponent": "St. Louis Blues", "wins": 107, "losses": 120, "opponentWins": "blues107" }, { "opponent": "Tampa Bay Lightning", "wins": 22, "losses": 11, "opponentWins": "lightning22" }, { "opponent": "Toronto Maple Leafs", "wins": 90, "losses": 90, "opponentWins": "mapleLeafs90" }, { "opponent": "Vancouver Canucks", "wins": 91, "losses": 67, "opponentWins": "canucks91" }, { "opponent": "Winnipeg Jets", "wins": 20, "losses": 9, "opponentWins": "wJets20" }, { "opponent": "Washington Capitals", "wins": 48, "losses": 27, "opponentWins": "capitals48" } ],"rivalryNotes":"The North Stars and the Blackhawks played each other in the playoffs six times from 1982 through 1991.

One meeting, in 1984, resulted in the Good Friday Massacre, a game in which multiple brawls happened.

The two teams played in Madison Square Garden however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born. The two teams first met in the playoffs via two-game total goals series in 1929. Both teams struggled to score in both games as goaltender Roy Worters of the Americans shut down the Rangers for the most part, and the Americans struggled to find offense during the games. The Rangers would win the series 1–0 in overtime.<BR><BR>The Americans then struggled to make the playoffs only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once America joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would"}], "directed": false, "multigraph": false }

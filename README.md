# [The Biggest Rivalries in Sports](http://sportsrivalri.es)
#### About
Intense rivalries have played an integral role in professional sports since professional sports began. While the competitive pressure affects players, coaches, and managers, it is perhaps felt most by the fans.Although often manifested in friendly competition, matchups occasionally lead to serious violence in the game and also in the stands.

Shown in this visualization are 127 rivalries (shown as thin lines) between 121 teams (shown as circles placed almost geographicly) in six major North American professional sports leagues.

Based on a print piece completed for William Bevington's Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics (PGDV 5100-A) at the New School in the Fall of 2016, this interactive visualization fullfills the requirements for the final project. Please explore by hovering, clicking, panning, and zooming. All data updates automatically on Thursday evenings, but its accuracy is not guaranteed.
